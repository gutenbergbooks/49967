<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">OAKVALE&rsquo;S ONE WISE MAN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe in it, I tell you! All a humbug!
No boy of mine will ever fool away his
time strutting around and wearing soldiers&rsquo;
clothes when he ought to be doing his chores
at home! Take that from me, young fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Prentice, if you care to ask any
one of the best citizens of Oakvale&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish of them to be so blind, I tell you,
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr. Hayward, the minister, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good man, but an easy mark all the
same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Judge Marshall!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surprised to hear that a long-headed man
like the judge should allow his name to be
used in connection with such utter foolishness.
If he had boys of his own instead of
three girls he might see things in a different
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Dr. Kane, and&mdash;well, the father of
every one of the thirty boys in the troop. In
fact, Mr. Prentice, I think you&rsquo;re almost the
only prominent man in or around Oakvale who
hasn&rsquo;t enthusiastically endorsed the local scout
troop, which they believe has made good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps this little shaft of flattery told. At
any rate the man called Mr. Prentice allowed
a glimmer of a grim smile to flit across his
stern face as he observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can say then, Hugh, is that the prominent
men of this section are a short-sighted lot
when they allow themselves to be so easily led
by the nose, and humbugged by a parcel of
prank-loving boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Worth nudged the leader of the Wolf
Patrol, Hugh Hardin, in the side. He acted
as though it might be on the tip of his tongue
to say something saucy; but for fear he might
thus injure the cause Hugh was so manfully
representing, Billy managed to remain silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Hugh made a final appeal, as he saw the
man was about to leave them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Mr. Prentice, you must have
heard <i>some</i> good things said about the scouts,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked, with one of his most
persuasive smiles; which, however, in this case,
seemed to be wasted on the one-idea man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; carelessly replied the other, gathering
up his lines preparatory to starting his
horse, &ldquo;a lot of <i>won</i>derful stories have come
floating over to my house, but I set most of
them down as exaggerations. When I was a
boy I read the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo; &lsquo;Baron Munchausen,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sindbad the Sailor,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s
Travels.&rsquo; I know how proud fathers like to
boast of their smart sons. I&rsquo;ve had my eye-teeth
cut, Hugh. You&rsquo;re a clever lad, I know,
but if you talked until doomsday you couldn&rsquo;t
change <i>my</i> mind about the folly of this Boy
Scout game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to his horse, and the two boys saw
him go down the road in a cloud of dust, for
it was the driest fall ever known about Oakvale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Billy Worth&mdash;who was a pretty ample sort
of a boy&mdash;a good-natured expression on his
face most of the time, doubled up like a hinge,
so far as his girth allowed, and seemed to be
quivering with mirth.</p>
<p>Hugh Hardin was shaking his head as
though he fancied he had run across about the
hardest <i>nut</i> to crack of all his experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there so funny about it, Billy?&rdquo;
he asked, for he was thinking how sorry he
would be to report an utter failure to poor
Addison Prentice, who was really wild to join
the scouts, and had begged Hugh to intercede
with his parent for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; gasped Billy, trying hard to
catch his breath. &ldquo;When you said he was the
only <i>prominent</i> man around here who didn&rsquo;t
think the scouts worth their salt, he had <i>nerve</i>
to say he pitied them all for disagreeing with
him. He made me think of a story I heard
long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on and tell it,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;for I
know you&rsquo;ll not be in shape to talk straight
again until you get it out of your system.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it was only that chestnut about an
Irishman who was on a jury that had to be
discharged because they could not come to any
agreement after being out ever so long. When
some one asked him what was the matter he
vowed he had never run across eleven such
pig-headed men in his life; and that he was
the only sensible member of the whole jury.
Hugh, that stubborn Irishman is Mr. Prentice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re pretty nearly right, Billy;
but don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve given up trying to influence
him on that account. Opposition only
makes the game more worth playing. Something
seems to tell me that we&rsquo;ll make Mr.
Prentice see a great light one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket, Hugh! &lsquo;Never give up
the ship!&rsquo; is our motto. We&rsquo;ll try and get up
some scheme to prove to Addison&rsquo;s dad that
he&rsquo;s barking up the wrong tree when he thinks
the scouts are a shiftless lot, who&rsquo;ve got a
reputation that hasn&rsquo;t any foundation in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were some little distance outside
of the town of Oakvale when they had this
conversation with Mr. Prentice, who owned
the big quarry toward which he was heading
when stopped on the dusty road by the chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Oakvale was proud of its troop of Boy
Scouts, and justly so. If you do not know why
this should be, it may pay you to secure a few
of the previous volumes in this series and read
what some of those boys had done to gain
such an enviable reputation among the thinking
people of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Even a glance over the titles of these books
will show the extent of their activities in the
time that had elapsed since the troop was first
organized. As Hugh and his comrades went
steadily on their way as the weeks and months
crept by, they were constantly finding numerous
opportunities to add to the esteem in which
they were held by the community.</p>
<p>Well had they proved the vast advantages
which scouts have over ordinary, unattached
boys in a country town. Organization had
done wonders for many of the members of the
troop. There was really not a single family
in Oakvale a member of which wore the khaki
of the troop but stood ready to openly declare
that a most radical change for the better had
followed since &ldquo;Tommy joined the scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh had received the proper credentials
from Headquarters to be an assistant scout
master; and sometimes during the temporary
absence of Lieutenant Denmead, a genial, retired
army officer who had willingly assumed
that office because of his love for boys, Hugh
filled his place acceptably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>If Mr. Prentice had not been one of the most
stubborn men alive, and if he had been open
to conviction, he certainly would never have
closed his ears to the stories that were told
of the doings of these Oakvale scouts, and
proven to be absolutely true.</p>
<p>Why, only on the preceding spring several
of them chancing to visit Lawrence, a town
many miles away, during the great freshet
which culminated in a disastrous flood, had
aroused the dormant local scout troop, almost
dead from lack of appreciation, and performed
prodigies in the way of saving distressed families
caught in their homes by the rising waters.</p>
<p>Then Hugh, on that same visit, had actually
saved the life of a reckless boy who ventured
onto a bridge threatened by the flood, snatching
him off after he had fallen and become
senseless just before a floating tree carried the
structure down amidst the boiling waters of
the torrent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Later on when they were in camp near a
large cement works it happened that there was
a strike by the hundreds of foreign workmen,
and the guards who had been brought from
the city to defend the strikebreakers fired upon
them.</p>
<p>As a result a dozen and more men, yes&mdash;and
women, too&mdash;among the ignorant foreigners
received serious gunshot wounds. Hugh and
some of his chums hurried to the spot, organized
a rude field hospital, and looked after the
injuries of the wounded in a manner that
called for high praise from the Red Cross surgeon
coming on the field later on at the summons
of Hugh Hardin.</p>
<p>For this great service, and for saving lives
at the same time, every scout who had taken a
part in that work now proudly displayed the
coveted bronze medal which is sent from Scout
Headquarters in New York City to any boy
wearing the khaki who saves a life. Hugh
was also the possessor of a gold medal, because
he had saved that lad from the doomed
bridge at the extreme risk of his own life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Then, to come down to a period only a short
time back, in the early days of the present dry
autumn, the scouts had served as guides at the
yearly County Fair in the vicinity of Oakvale.
They had met trains, directed visitors to boarding
places, answered innumerable questions,
run errands, taken telegrams, and last but far
from least, rendered first aid to the injured
to a considerable number of persons who came
to grief among the jostling throngs that visited
the Exposition grounds.</p>
<p>(What else Hugh and some of his nearest
and dearest chums managed to do during that
time will be found narrated in the pages of
the preceding volumes; and they should afford
interesting reading to all who are concerned
with the education of boys along other lines
than those connected with ordinary school
life.)</p>
<p>Hugh and Billy walked slowly on after their
meeting with Mr. Prentice, which had been an
accidental one. They saw that he had stopped
his horse a little further along the road, and
appeared to be examining some part of the
hillside, since his extensive quarry ran for a
quarter of a mile along the road.</p>
<p>The boys had climbed up the slope and were
standing by the little narrow-gauge track down
which cars loaded with stone were allowed to
drop, checked by a brake, to the base of the
hill, where wagons came and went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>This track crossed the county road at a certain
place below where the two boys were
standing. In reality it was a dangerous thing
to allow, but during working hours the quarry
company always kept a signal man there to see
that vehicles were warned to keep back, whenever
a car came down the almost level incline.
An overhead trolley drew the empty car back
up the rise again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t that a queer thing how that
wagonload of children has gone and stopped
right on the track of the stone chute!&rdquo; exclaimed
Billy, suddenly. &ldquo;My stars! they must
have got a wheel caught in the track somehow,
for the horses don&rsquo;t seem able to drag it off
worth a cent. It would give the children a
bad scare now if one of those stone cars started
down the hill, eh, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be hoped nothing of the kind happens,&rdquo;
said Hugh, &ldquo;though with the brake set
the man on the car could stop it easily enough.
I was just wondering who those children are,
and I&rsquo;ve guessed it. They come from the orphan
asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Sim Reeves&rsquo; rig, of the town
livery stable, and he&rsquo;s a good-hearted man, so
I guess he loaned the wagon and driver just
to give the poor kids a little outing on this fine
Saturday afternoon. But I wish they&rsquo;d hurry
and get that wagon moving, for as sure as
you live there&rsquo;s a car loaded with stone starting
slowly down the incline now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Hugh, thrilled by
the thought of a catastrophe overtaking those
innocents below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man on it can&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s anything
wrong down at the crossing,&rdquo; cried
Billy in great excitement. &ldquo;He will soon, and
put on the brakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Billy continued to keep his eyes glued
on the coming car, Hugh on the other hand
allowed his gaze to roam around. He even
took several steps over to one side as though
measuring the distance separating him from
the track at a certain place.</p>
<p>All at once Billy gave a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! look! look! the brake&rsquo;s given way!
There goes the man jumping for his life, and
listen to the children screaming, will you?
Hugh, can&rsquo;t we do something? It&rsquo;ll get going
faster and faster, and&mdash;oh! Hugh, the poor,
poor kids!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT PRESENCE OF MIND MEANT.</span></h2>
<p>While Billy Worth was talking Hugh was
acting. That seemed to be a chronic habit with
the scout master. An emergency never caused
him to quail, and as a rule he could be depended
on to do the right thing at the right time.</p>
<p>That was where the benefit of his preliminary
look around came in. The very second
that he discovered the accident to the descending
stone-laden flat-car, Hugh knew that it was
up to him to do something in order to save
those imperiled orphans from a terrible calamity.</p>
<p>The car was on a run of the track that was
very nearly level, so that as yet it had not attained
the very great velocity sure to follow,
after it came over the crown of the rise, just
above where the two boys stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Hugh stooped and caught hold of a small
log that he had noticed when he made his movement
in the direction of the track. It took all
his strength to lift it up, and Billy would have
been of great assistance could his wits have
served him as speedily as was the case with
the scout leader.</p>
<p>With a tremendous effort Hugh raised the
log and hurled it upon the track. Just as he
intended it should do, it fell with one end
braced in a cavity, and the other pointing upwards.
When the onrushing heavy car struck
that obstruction, it could not very well go any
further, but must be hurled from the track.</p>
<p>All this happened almost in a breath. The
car had now reached the edge of the steeper
descent, and was seen by the frightened children
below. Some of the youngsters were being
flung from the wagon by the driver, but
there would never have been time to have saved
them all before the constantly increasing speed
of the runaway car brought it upon the trapped
wagon.</p>
<p>The horses, as though conscious of their
peril, pranced and jumped wildly, but for all
their antics did not seem able to release the
imprisoned wheel. As for the children they
shrieked louder than ever, for the anticipated
danger had become a real one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Billy began to realize that his more active
chum had done something while he was only
standing there shivering. He also found
Hugh&rsquo;s hand gripped on his arm, and that he
was being dragged hastily back from the track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Billy, as with a rush and a
roar the laden stone car came speeding down
the incline.</p>
<p>Hugh held his very breath in fear lest the
uptilted log might not project far enough to
catch the base of the heavy car. But it turned
out all right.</p>
<p>There was a mighty crash when car and log
came in collision, and Hugh saw the descending
vehicle of transportation flung bodily aside.
It landed in a heap upside-down&mdash;something
of a wreck, with the rocks scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>Billy tried to shout, but his best effort was
hardly more than a whisper, such was the reaction
that instantly set in when he saw the
danger to the orphans was a thing of the past.</p>
<p>He did manage to seize Hugh&rsquo;s hand and
pat it tenderly, as though in that way he could
find an outlet for the mingled emotions of
gratitude and pride that filled his loyal heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Some scouts might have immediately hurried
down, to allow themselves to be made heroes
of by those who had witnessed this presence
of mind on the part of the boy. That
was not Hugh Hardin&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down if you want to, Billy,&rdquo; he told
the other, when importuned to descend to the
road. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve managed to get a lever under
the wheel now, and pried it loose, so they can
go on. I want to see just how the car struck,
and how close it came to passing over the log
without connecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed to be the point giving him the
greatest satisfaction; for he found that had the
stout little log been six inches shorter, it would
have failed to throw the car from the track.
What that meant made Hugh shiver as he
looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Mr. Prentice up to see what
happened!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing this accident may bring
about,&rdquo; remarked Hugh, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a change
in this grade. The stone cars should never
cross the road at all, but go over or under it.
When the town council hears about this new
trouble, mark my words if they don&rsquo;t make
him change his grade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just like him to blame you for
smashing his car, Hugh,&rdquo; said Billy, who apparently
did not entertain a very high opinion
of the owner of the big stone quarry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him!&rdquo; replied the other, unconcernedly.
&ldquo;The driver of the wagon must have seen all
that happened. I&rsquo;d be willing to go on record
for what I&rsquo;ve done. Still, knowing the kind
of a man he is, I hardly expect to be thanked
for saving him from a lot of lawsuits that
might bankrupt him; or perhaps even being
accused of criminal carelessness in a coroner&rsquo;s
court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prentice came climbing hurriedly to the
scene of the wreck. There was an awed expression
on his face in place of its habitual
stern look. The man who had jumped from
the car when the brake gave way, and who was
an ignorant foreigner, reached the spot about
the same time.</p>
<p>The owner of the quarry examined the remains
of his heavy car. Then he looked at the
track, and discovered the partly broken log
projecting upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who put that log in there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, Mr. Prentice,&rdquo; answered Hugh,
modestly but firmly; &ldquo;but only when I saw that
the car was heading downward, and that it
would likely strike the wagonload of children
stalled on the crossing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prentice did not say another word. He
looked hard at the boy, who did not allow his
eyes to drop a particle. Mr. Prentice was
thinking many things just then; his mind must
have been in a riotous condition.</p>
<p>He went back and again looked around at
the scene of the wreck, up the hill, then down
to where the wagon had been stalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he understands pretty well what a
great thing you did for him when you jumped
that car off the track, Hugh,&rdquo; muttered Billy,
as they watched the quarry owner moving
around, and talking with the man who had
abandoned the runaway car on finding the
brake had given way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m hoping is that he makes up his
mind now never to drop another load of rock
down this grade till he&rsquo;s made it safe for anyone
passing on the county road below,&rdquo; Hugh
replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t even thank you, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never expected he would, and it doesn&rsquo;t
matter a particle to me if he keeps on forgetting
to,&rdquo; said the scout master, smilingly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough satisfaction in <i>knowing</i>
you&rsquo;ve done your duty, without looking for
thanks or praise. The feeling that comes from
within beats any outside commendation all
hollow, according to my way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;d just like to tell the old man what
I think of him,&rdquo; grumbled the indignant Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For fear you might be tempted to say something
you&rsquo;d be sorry for afterward,&rdquo; remarked
Hugh, &ldquo;suppose we slip down to the road and
head for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though still grumbling, and evidently feeling
pretty hard toward Mr. Prentice, Billy
could not refuse to keep his chum company as
the other started down the side of the hill in
the direction of the road. He looked back
several times, however, and said a few things
half under his breath, which could not have
been very complimentary to the quarryman, if
the sour expression on Billy&rsquo;s round face stood
for anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Once down at the crossing the scouts stopped
to exchange a few words with the man who
was stationed there to signal when a car was
coming. He, too, chanced to be a Polock and
could not talk English very well, so Hugh
looked for himself to see how it happened the
wheel of the heavily-laden wagon came to be
trapped in the way they had seen, and just at
the wrong time.</p>
<p>Then they surveyed the situation so as to see
whether it would be possible to build an overhead
track, or dig one under the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done as easy as anything,&rdquo; said
Billy, after they had discussed this phase of
the question. &ldquo;You mark my words, this near-accident
is going to be the last straw on the
camel&rsquo;s back. There&rsquo;s been talk of making
him change his grade a number of times! now
it&rsquo;s got to come. And, Hugh, they&rsquo;ve got to
thank you for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! come on, let&rsquo;s be on the hike for home!&rdquo;
laughed the other, shaking his head as if to
warn Billy he would not stop to listen to anything
that bordered on praise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Billy was muttering to himself as he followed,
this time vowing that he&rsquo;d see to it
Hugh received all possible honor for having
done a clever thing, in spite of his modesty
about owning up to it.</p>
<p>As they entered the outskirts of the town it
happened that they came upon a boy who must
have seen them from a store near by, for he
came running out to intercept the two scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Addison!&rdquo; said Billy, giving
Hugh a wink as much as to say: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
queer that you sometimes run across the very
fellow you&rsquo;re thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; said the boy, who was not as robust
as he might have been, and had rather a pasty
look about his face, which indicated too little
outdoor exercise, &ldquo;tell me, have you seen him
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh knew that he must give the other a
grievous disappointment, but he would have to
be told some time, and it had better be over
with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it happened that we ran across your
father up the road just a little while back, Addison,
and thinking it as good a chance as any
to speak to him about you joining the scouts, I
started in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t have any luck, did you,
Hugh?&rdquo; asked the boy, in a trembling voice,
and with a disappointed look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say I didn&rsquo;t seem to convince
him just then that it would be a good thing
for you to join the troop, Addison,&rdquo; replied
Hugh.</p>
<p>The boy drew a long breath. His lower lip
quivered, and Billy ground his teeth in sudden
anger at the short-sighted policy of a father
who could not see how much necessity there
was for a boy like Addison to be encouraged
to take all the outdoor exercise he could get
in order to build up his physical strength, and
his nervous system in the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just expected it would be that way,
Hugh,&rdquo; he said, presently, &ldquo;though you do
have such splendid luck telling things that I
kept hugging a little hope he might look into
the matter, anyway. But it&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I wouldn&rsquo;t say that if I were you, Addison,&rdquo;
Hugh told him. &ldquo;One of the very first
things a scout is taught is never to give a thing
up until he&rsquo;s exhausted every possible effort.
And I haven&rsquo;t thrown the job over yet by any
means.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Addison tried to smile, but the effort was a
dismal failure. He looked more inclined to
break down and cry than anything else, Billy
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to say that, Hugh, and I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ll do all you can; but I&rsquo;ve nearly lost
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that notion out of your head, first of
all, I tell you, Addison. I expect to see your
father again, and while I can&rsquo;t explain what
I mean, still there are certain things working
that may make him see matters in an entirely
new light. Even Mr. Prentice has had to
change his mind a few times in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, in a business way, Hugh, but you
don&rsquo;t know my father. He&rsquo;s got his notions
of how boys ought to toe the chalk line, and
nothing that can ever happen will make him
look at things differently. It&rsquo;s all up with me,
and I&rsquo;ll never be a scout, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Hugh told him, as they separated,
&ldquo;there is still plenty of hope. I&rsquo;ll be working
for you, and a lot of the other boys will, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">THE THREATENING PERIL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such a queer looking sun,
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud Morgan, when he made this remark to
a group of other boys, stood on the campus
of the Oakvale High School. Besides Bud
there were present Arthur Cameron, Dale
Evans, Billy Worth, Chester Brownell and
Blake Merton, all of them scouts, although
not wearing their khaki suits at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could you expect,&rdquo; Arthur went
on to say, &ldquo;when we&rsquo;ve had such a terribly dry
fall? Why, the roads are an inch deep with
dust right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought to know about that,&rdquo; added
Dale Evans. &ldquo;Only yesterday I had a chance
after school to go with a party in his car. We
made a run of thirty miles in all, heading
south, and twice we had to stop at wells to
wash the dust down our throats. I never saw
anything like it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Another boy, who had been hurrying toward
the group, came up while this talk was going
on. His name was Alec Sands, leader of the
Otter Patrol of the scouts.</p>
<p>There had been a time when Alec was a bitter
enemy and a keen rival of Hugh Hardin
for first honors; but when the latter forged
ahead Alec came to his senses, and ever since
they had been the best of friends, even chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you, Arthur,&rdquo; he now exclaimed,
which remark of course drew the attention
of all the others to Alec, just as he intended
it should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the boy spoken to,
who had a great reputation among his fellows
as a coming authority in things pertaining to
surgery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in times gone by we&rsquo;ve always looked
up to you as a regular weather sharp and
prophet; yet here you are agreeing with the
rest of this ignorant bunch, and taking it for
granted that the dry weather and the dust is
the cause for that red sun. You&rsquo;re away off,
all of you; it&rsquo;s smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy Worth. &ldquo;Then,
as they expected, the forest has been set afire.
Is that what you mean, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where there&rsquo;s smoke it stands to reason
there&rsquo;s likely to be a fire back of it,&rdquo; Alec
told him, a little sarcastically it must be admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about it, Alec?&rdquo; demanded
Dale Evans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, open up and tell us, like a good fellow,&rdquo;
added Blake Merton.</p>
<p>A clamorous circle of eager faces met Alec&rsquo;s
eye as he looked around. It pleased him to be
the center of attraction, even in such a small
matter as this, for Alec had not wholly mastered
his love for power, which in the old days
had been his besetting sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was in this way I learned about it,&rdquo;
he began, deliberately. &ldquo;I had occasion to go
down to the post office just before school this
morning, and there was a crowd of people
around police headquarters. I thought the
Chief might have been arresting some negro
kid for playing craps, or something like that,
so I stepped over just out of idle curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what was it all about?&rdquo; asked one of
the others, as Alec purposely stopped so as to
further arouse their eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, messengers had come in from up
north, asking for help to fight the forest fires
that were getting more furious every hour. All
sorts of stories were told about farms being
burned over, people having to flee in the night
with what clothes they had on their backs, and
others being trapped in the burning woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys exchanged looks of sudden anxiety.
It was no laughing matter then, this having a
forest fire sweep down upon a little settlement
or community, with everything dry as tinder,
and ready to burst into flames.</p>
<p>They turned as if by one impulse and looked
long and earnestly toward the north. Some
of them began to sniff the air suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I do believe the wind&rsquo;s changing right
into the north,&rdquo; said Chester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can get a whiff of wood smoke all
right!&rdquo; added Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the fire can be around Rainbow
Lake where we always had our summer camp
in the good old days?&rdquo; remarked another member
of the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>They were not alone in their scrutiny of the
heavens, for other scholars, girls as well as
boys, had begun to notice the distinct odor of
smoke in the air, and were commenting on it,
showing signs of growing excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look close, fellows,&rdquo; remarked Alec,
who had very keen eyes, &ldquo;you can see a sort of
dull haze low down near the horizon. That&rsquo;s
the smoke, and it&rsquo;s heading this way in the
bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you can see it moving like a cloud
even while you watch!&rdquo; declared Dale. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it covered the town
like a regular blanket before long and frightened
the women folks and children half to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something doing up that way, all
right,&rdquo; said Blake Merton. &ldquo;I can just imagine
the thick woods that lie all around the base of
Old Stormberg in sight of Pinnacle Peak,
ablaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be up there
to see the sight!&rdquo; remarked Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to help fight the fire in the bargain,&rdquo;
added Alec. &ldquo;That would be more than half
the fun for me. I had one experience some
years back when visiting some relatives in the
country. It was a hot old time, too, and we
came near losing the farm buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood there staring at the horizon toward
the far north as though fascinated by
the sight of that low hanging but advancing
cloud, which all of them had decided must be
smoke from the forest fires.</p>
<p>Play was forgotten that morning on the
campus. Groups of boys and girls stood about,
and talked, and looked. Already the shadow
of a possible calamity for Oakvale seemed to
have permeated the air. There were no loud
shouts heard, and many of the more timid ones
even lowered their voices when speaking of the
new peril that had arisen to menace the peace
of the community.</p>
<p>Long before the bell rang to call them within
the buildings the pall of smoke had reached the
town, and enveloped it. It looked weird and
yellow and threatening. It also caused the
tears to come unbidden to weak eyes; and
whichever way they looked they could see the
housewives of Oakvale standing at their front
gates to exchange comments with the neighbors,
equally appalled and alarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I don&rsquo;t see how there&rsquo;s going to be
any lessons to-day with all this excitement in
town,&rdquo; remarked Billy, as he heard the summons
to indicate that school was about to take
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than the day the circus came to
town,&rdquo; suggested Spike Welling, who was another
member of the scout troop.</p>
<p>When the scholars had come together in the
large assembly hall it could be easily seen that
many of them were in a poor condition for
study or recitations. Some of the girls looked
alarmed, and others had the appearance of
being on the border of an attack of hysterics.
Home was certainly the best place for them
under such distressing conditions.</p>
<p>The principal, Professor Marvin, who was
new to the school that year, though already
well liked, looked exceedingly grave as he
watched the scholars file in to take their accustomed
places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to make some sort of an announcement,
take my word for it,&rdquo; Dick Bellamy
managed to whisper to Billy, as their
heads came close together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I only hope it means we&rsquo;re going to
be dismissed for the day,&rdquo; muttered the stout
boy. &ldquo;Then there might be some sort of way
for a fellow to get up there, and see just what
a forest fire looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Marvin stood up, with elevated
hand, and you could have heard a pin drop,
since the utmost silence fell upon the assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a most important communication to
make to you this morning, young ladies and
young gentlemen,&rdquo; said the head master, who
always made it a point to speak in a dignified
way when addressing them. &ldquo;Word has been
received that the forest is on fire to the north
of our town, and that there is serious danger
of its coming this way. Men are needed to
help fight the flames, and it would be folly to
try and keep you here in school when no one
is fitted for lessons. So I am going to dismiss
you for the day. It depends on the weather
whether there will be any further session of
the school during the remainder of the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the boys acted as though they felt
like giving a cheer, but something seemed to
restrain them. If people were suffering, perhaps
being ruined by the spread of the fire,
so near Oakvale, it was no time for merriment
or exulting over an unexpected holiday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>In their regular order, just as they had been
taught in their fire drills, the scholars filed out
of school. There was no confusion, no pushing,
and little excitement visible.</p>
<p>No sooner had they reached the grounds
than they looked about them, appalled at the
changes which had taken place in the short
time they had been inside. The smoke cloud
had swooped down upon the town with a vengeance.
They could see waves of the dense
vapor scurrying along. At times it was hard
to see a block away.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller children coming from
the kindergarten classes in another school
building near by, were crying as they ran along
toward home, nor could any one really blame
them for feeling frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! this beats anything I ever saw before!&rdquo;
Monkey Stallings was saying as he
caught up with several other boys. (He had
come by that queer name through his great
love for acrobatic feats, and one of his favorite
pranks was to hang by his toes from the
limb of a tree as though he were in truth a
simian.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;There goes a party of fire-fighters off in
that car!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy Worth, as a large
touring car swept past, headed into the north,
filled with some of the lusty men of the town,
all in old clothes as though they anticipated a
pretty hard tussle with the fire after they
reached the front.</p>
<p>The look Billy cast after them told that deep
down in his heart he was wishing he had a
chance to hang on behind, so as to get up where
things were happening. Billy liked to be in the
midst of stirring events, though one would
hardly believe it when they observed his build,
for he was unusually stout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;ll be mighty little business
down in Oakvale to-day,&rdquo; suggested Don Miller,
the leader of the Fox Patrol. &ldquo;There goes
Mr. Allison, the grocer, with Mudge, the
butcher, in a buggy. As you live, there&rsquo;s our
principal, Professor Marvin, crowding in along
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the right kind of school teacher; let&rsquo;s
give him three cheers when he passes by!&rdquo;
cried another of the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>They did give them with a hearty vim, and
the head master seemed pleased, for he waved
his hat at them and bowed. Evidently, when
there was a need of men, Professor Marvin
was ready to meet his obligations. He would
undoubtedly do his little part in fighting the
flames or saving imperiled country folks from
being burned alive.</p>
<p>More than ever did Billy wish he could start
off. He was trying to figure out whether it
would pay to ask some of the other fellows to
join him, and get a rig of some sort at the
livery stable. They could, in this way, manage
to make their way up closer to the raging fires,
and see what things looked like, perhaps find
a chance to help some of those who were being
burned out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could see Hugh now, we might
manage to get up a scheme between us,&rdquo; he
was telling himself; and then calling out to
the others he continued: &ldquo;Has any one seen
Hugh since we came out of school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had a glimpse of him running for all
he was worth,&rdquo; one boy announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I wonder what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; exclaimed Billy;
and then he held his breath in rapture as the
bell of the church where they held their meetings
began to toll so loudly that the sounds
could be heard all over town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>There were three sonorous strokes, then a
pause, followed by three more. And every
scout recognized it as the signal agreed on that
was designed to be a &ldquo;hurry call&rdquo; for the troop
to assemble at the meeting place!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE CALL OF DUTY.</span></h2>
<p>Billy immediately threw his arms around the
nearest fellow who happened to be Monkey
Stallings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that summons, boys!&rdquo; he cried, as he
hugged the other in his overbounding enthusiasm.
&ldquo;It means Hugh has decided that the
scouts ought to go up there in a body, and fight
the forest fires! Just what I was wishing
would happen! When there&rsquo;s anything <i>big</i>
going on, <i>we&rsquo;re</i> the boys to get moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me loose, you bear!&rdquo; gasped Monkey
Stallings as he struggled in the enveloping
arms of the other. &ldquo;Do you want to squeeze
me to death? Say, you can hug worse than
any grizzly that ever came to town. Please
don&rsquo;t try that game on me in a hurry again,
Billy! I&rsquo;m too ticklish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, everybody, let&rsquo;s put for the meeting
place, and find out what&rsquo;s in the wind!&rdquo;
called Don Miller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it was sure enough wood smoke,
from the way it smarts your eyes,&rdquo; declared
another of the group, though no one laughed
at his intended witticism, for they had more
serious things to weigh upon their minds.</p>
<p>Boys were seen coming on the run from
various directions. All of them converged toward
the bell, still throbbing its startling message.
The cry of Paul Revere in those old
Continental days could hardly have thrilled
the hearts of those who lived in Massachusetts
villages and hamlets any more than the
brazen notes of that bell did the gathering
scouts.</p>
<p>Some were in uniform, others not, but that
was a matter of very little importance just
then. They were wild to learn why this hasty
call had gone forth; and hoping it meant a
chance to enter the fight against the oncoming
forest fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Not only boys were running, for girls,
women, and some men could be seen hastening
toward the church. Like wildfire the news
would spread that the scouts were going to
take a hand in the game, and somehow people
had come to place a wonderful amount of faith
in Hugh Hardin and his comrades.</p>
<p>True, thirty mere boys could not do much
when they tried to pit their puny powers
against so savage a thing as a raging forest
fire. Still, somehow, those good people had
come to feel a degree of confidence in the ability
of the troop to accomplish things. Their
past history was a splendid one, and on a number
of occasions never to be forgotten, they
had attained triumphs that made Oakvale very
proud to own them.</p>
<p>So from lip to lip went the cry: &ldquo;The scouts
are going out to fight the fire!&rdquo; Mothers, who
had boys enrolled in the troop, surveyed that
dark pall of smoke and turned pale with new
apprehension. It seemed as though some
frightful peril might be hovering off where
those fires burned; and while it was right
sturdy men should go forth to assist those in
distress, each mother&rsquo;s heart was a battleground
of pride and fear as she contemplated
the possibility of some disaster overtaking the
boy she loved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The crowd grew in volume as minutes
passed. Each scout upon arriving pushed in
so as to reach the center of the gathering.
When Hugh and Walter Osborne, the Hawk
leader, came out of the church, they having
been ringing the loud-pealing bell, it was a
startling scene that met their eyes.</p>
<p>Fully three hundred people had gathered
there. The appearance of the assistant scout
master was greeted with loud cheers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing, Hugh?&rdquo; cried one eager boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going up to the foot of Old Stormberg?&rdquo;
asked another.</p>
<p>When Hugh stepped forward and held up
his hand all these voices stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great need of help up there, they
say,&rdquo; he told them in a ringing tone, &ldquo;not only
to fight the fires, but to save property, perhaps
helpless people who have been burned out and
are in danger. If we went in a body we might
find a chance to make ourselves useful; and
so I have decided to ask the members of Oakvale
Troop to join with me in the work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Scores of lusty voices took up the cheer until
the volume of sound rolled along through that
entire part of the town. Those women who
had remained at home, though still at their
gates, with aprons over their heads it might be,
seemed readily to guess what that vociferous
cheer in boyish voices meant.</p>
<p>The scouts were going! Strange how a little
thing like that could give them a thrill, but
it seemed to all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; continued Hugh, when the
clamor which his announcement had caused
died away, &ldquo;it is optional with every one of you
whether he goes or not. You can be of great
service to those who are in trouble. Still, if
any scout&rsquo;s mother does not wish him to be of
our party he should stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that happening, Hugh!&rdquo;
called out one boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the right kind of mothers, and
they&rsquo;ve proved it in the past. Count on a full
attendance, Hugh!&rdquo; another informed him, at
which there were further loud cheers.</p>
<p>After that it was hardly to be expected that
any mother would dream of objecting to her
boy going to the front, no matter how her fond
heart might be gripped with natural fears.
Pride would step in and make sure that the
finger of scorn should never be pointed at <i>her</i>
boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get away home now, fellers,&rdquo; said Hugh,
&ldquo;and change your clothes. Put on any old suit
you&rsquo;ve got, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it looks like.
With sparks flying around you&rsquo;re apt to have
some damage done before we come back.
Don&rsquo;t waste any time, but get back here. We
start in exactly half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew that every single boy would be on
the run, and eager to get back to the rendezvous
long before those thirty minutes had expired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing!&rdquo; Hugh called out as they
were starting away, &ldquo;bring canteens along with
you if you have them; and don&rsquo;t forget your
big red bandana handkerchief above all things,
with an old campaign hat that will protect
your neck from any sparks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There never existed a more excited lot of
boys than Oakvale boasted about that time.
All over town they could be seen running
wildly this way and that, with people trying
to ask questions which the hustling scouts were
too busy to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>By the time fifteen minutes had expired a
dozen of them had arrived at the designated
meeting place, all flushed and eager. One after
another the rest came on the run, showing
signs of relief at finding they were not too late.</p>
<p>Had any scout been actually left behind on
that occasion he would have been the most
heart-broken fellow ever seen. The crowd
was greater than ever as new arrivals constantly
augmented it. A buzz of tongues told
that the women were trying to explain how
matters stood to those who could not understand
what all this excitement meant.</p>
<p>Hugh was keeping count of the boys as they
came up. He had them ranged alongside the
wall of the church, so that he would know when
the full quota had arrived. It pleased him to
see how anxious they all were to join their fortunes
with the expedition that was about to set
forth, bent on a new work of usefulness.</p>
<p>It still lacked five minutes of the appointed
time, and yet Hugh believed that every member
of the troop who might be expected to
gather had done so. Two boys he knew were
sick at home, and another was away from
town; but the rest were on hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use waiting any longer, Hugh!&rdquo;
called out Billy Worth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all on deck,
you see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Everybody stopped talking when Hugh was
seen to step forward again, and raise his hand.
This boy had won the respect of Oakvale
through his manly qualities. He had even
managed to disarm the enmity of certain boys
who at one time had striven to throw every
obstacle possible in his path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to start off, fellows,&rdquo; he announced,
cheerily; &ldquo;and it isn&rsquo;t too late yet for
any one who isn&rsquo;t in good shape to do a lot of
work to drop back. Fall in, double file, and
we&rsquo;ll be moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly they obeyed. Not a single boy
dropped out of line; indeed, just then it would
have required a most powerful lever to have
dragged any of them aside. They did not
know what awaited them up where that billowing
smoke came from; possibly it might
mean danger, and surely suffering from the
pungent vapor that smarted the eyes, but they
believed duty called them, and they were wild
to go.</p>
<p>The crowd parted to let them pass through.
Other boys who did not belong to the troop
cheered them as they walked smartly along,
keeping excellent military step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>There were no inspiring notes of the bugle
to cheer them this time, no exhilarating throb
of the drum to enliven their steps; but nevertheless
every boy&rsquo;s face was an index to the
feelings of his heart, and they shone with delight.</p>
<p>On down the street they went, followed by
the crowd that seemed bent on seeing the last
of them. Never had the scouts presented a
more manly bearing, though all of them were
shabbily dressed, a few in cast-off khaki suits,
others wearing such garments as they could
find around home of the kind that it would
not matter if they were utterly ruined in the
fire-fighting.</p>
<p>Now they had passed beyond the outskirts
of the town. The crowd had left them with a
parting cheer. Ahead lay the road leading to
the region being devastated by the furious
flames. Sturdily they set out to walk all the
way up to the burning woods in order that they
might be of some assistance to those in distress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">CARRIED TO THE FRONT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be something of a hike for us,
I reckon,&rdquo; Billy Worth remarked, as they covered
the first half mile of ground.</p>
<p>While Billy&rsquo;s ambition knew no bounds, and
he was always ready to attempt any feat which
others, who were much more nimble, could accomplish,
he was often sadly handicapped by
his extra weight. Although the rest of the
boys were swinging lightly along, and thinking
nothing of the exertion, Billy was puffing like
a porpoise. He was also secretly mopping his
face with his red bandana handkerchief, which
he had knotted loosely around his neck, cowpuncher
fashion, a trick most scouts are fond
of emulating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;re all sorry on your account,
Billy,&rdquo; ventured Buck Winters. &ldquo;Hiking never
was your best hold. If a prize was offered
to the longest sitter, you&rsquo;d come under the wire
a victor every time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a good thing to cut down your heft
some, too, Billy,&rdquo; another scout told him.
&ldquo;Nothing half so fine as sweating it off. That&rsquo;s
what all the prize fighters do when they have
to get into trim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; called out Alec, for they were not
trying to keep any sort of order now, each
tramping along with some comrade he had
picked out, though not strung out over more
than ten yards of road, &ldquo;have you been able to
learn what sort of a fire it is up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that the woods are ablaze for a long
distance,&rdquo; replied the scout master. &ldquo;Some
accounts say the fire front is five miles long,
and growing every hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked,&rdquo; continued Alec, &ldquo;because there
are two kinds of forest fires. One, and the
most terrible, is where the trees themselves
are burning, and that means the utter ruination
of the whole tract. I&rsquo;ve seen miles and
miles up in Michigan where only stumps stand
up like fingers. I certainly hope that isn&rsquo;t going
to be the case here, for we&rsquo;d miss those
woods the worst way in summertime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you spoke of another sort of fire, Alec;
tell us about it?&rdquo; asked Shorty McNeil, whose
hobby lay in collecting strange plants, and who
on that account would be very sorry to see the
forest ruined, since he spent much of his spare
time under the trees, searching for new varieties
of wild flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, at this time of the year,&rdquo; Alec went
on to explain, &ldquo;when most of the leaves have
fallen, if a spark drops among them and a fire
follows it runs along the ground, eating up all
the dead stuff. It makes a terrible smoke, and
lights up the sky nights, but it isn&rsquo;t so dangerous
as the other sort of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which kind would you think this one will
turn out to be, Alec?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather believe it was the bush sort,
though it may turn out some of the trees are
ablaze, too. You see, all sorts of logs lying on
the ground, dead stumps, piles of wood cut for
fence rails and that sort of stuff gets to going
with the rest, so it makes a fierce blaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with this strong wind blowing it must
travel pretty fast at that, I take it,&rdquo; remarked
Bud Morgan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out back there!&rdquo; shouted Ralph Kenyon,
&ldquo;some sort of car coming along in a big
hurry; don&rsquo;t block the road. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the
Oakvale fire department starting on to lend a
hand at putting the blaze down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph had once upon a time spent much of
his time in the woods. In summer he had
hunted for places where patches of wild ginseng
or golden rod grew, the roots of which he
dug up in season, dried, and sold at a good
profit.</p>
<p>Then, too, in the winter, he had been wont
to trap all sorts of small fur-bearing animals
for the sake of their pelts, which brought him
in a fair price when sent to a dealer in the city.</p>
<p>Ralph had seen a great light after he joined
the scouts. Nothing could tempt him nowadays
to injure an innocent little animal, merely
in order that he might increase his savings
bank account. He had even grown to enjoy
watching them frolic in their native haunts
which he knew so well.</p>
<p>While others were thinking wholly of human
misery apt to follow this sweep of the fire,
Ralph had an aching heart for the wood&rsquo;s denizens
who, caught in the trap, were apt to perish
miserably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The tooting of an automobile horn told that
the car coming behind them was close to the
bend they had just recently turned. Warned
in time, the scouts crowded to the side of the
road and left an open space for it to pass
through.</p>
<p>No sooner did they glimpse the car than the
boys started shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Lewis, the liveryman!&rdquo; one
called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got his big rubberneck twenty-passenger
car, too!&rdquo; cried a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! it&rsquo;s empty, don&rsquo;t you notice, fellows!&rdquo;
came from a third keen-eyed boy. The sight-seeing
tourist car came to a stop alongside the
waiting boys. The man at the wheel gave
them a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pile aboard every one of you, like hot
cakes!&rdquo; he told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this mean, Mr. Lewis?&rdquo; asked
Hugh. &ldquo;Have you come after us with your
rig to help get us up to the fire lines?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; replied the other,
heartily. &ldquo;You boys have done so many fine
things for Oakvale that we&rsquo;re all proud of you.
We want to do what little we can to help you
along. I thought of my car too late to get you
in town, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me. Find seats
all who can, and the rest hang on like grim
death. We&rsquo;re going to start now. All aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those that can&rsquo;t get aboard get a rail!&rdquo;
called Billy, who being one of the first to clamber
up on the &ldquo;rubberneck&rdquo; or sight-seeing car
had managed to install himself in a comfortable
seat in the middle, where he could not be
crowded off.</p>
<p>They were soon going along at a fast clip,
the boys giving a shout every time one of the
&ldquo;thank-you-mums&rdquo; in the road, intended to
throw off the water in heavy rain storms,
caused them to jolt up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a thousand per cent. better than
walking, let me tell you, everybody!&rdquo; asserted
Billy Worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fine idea for you to think of us as
you did, Mr. Lewis,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save us some hours of hard work, which
would leave us in a poor shape to fight fires,
I should say,&rdquo; Bud Morgan declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;After I drop you as near the fire as I care
to venture with my car,&rdquo; the liveryman said,
&ldquo;I expect to turn around somehow, and run
back for another load. There will be plenty
of men volunteers to come up and work. With
Oakvale threatened with total destruction,
none of the mills or factories will think of keeping
their employees on duty, so I ought to pick
up a number of loads of fire-fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too many,&rdquo; asserted Alec, as
though his past experience told him that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but this smoke is no joke, let me
tell you!&rdquo; complained Monkey Stallings, digging
his knuckles into his smarting eyes, from
which the tears were springing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Hugh,&rdquo; Alec now asked,
&ldquo;are we going to try and beat out the fire or
will we put in our time saving some of the
threatened farm buildings? We ought to
know all this country up around Pioneer Lake
like a book; and once we get our bearings it&rsquo;ll
be easy for us to tell whose place is most in
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most cases,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;as far as I
know, when a forest fire gets fully started, and
with a wind to drive it on, all the men that
could be got together can&rsquo;t stop the spread of
the flames. They&rsquo;re bound to keep on jumping
ahead with all the sparks blowing until it
rains and puts the fire out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll devote our time to helping farmers,
will we?&rdquo; asked one of the boys, a little
note of disappointment discernible in his tone,
for he had evidently pictured himself as a heroic
figure forcing the fire demon to obey his
will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are,&rdquo; Hugh told him, &ldquo;that
we&rsquo;ll get all the work we want in trying to
protect the sheds, hay-stacks, barns, and houses
that are in danger of being devoured by the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct, Hugh,&rdquo; assented Alec.
&ldquo;Mr. Lewis, I think you&rsquo;re wrong in believing
any fire could reach Oakvale. There happens
to be a pretty wide open stretch to the north
of the town, where we play ball, you remember.
It couldn&rsquo;t cross that, as the grass is
short, and even boys could beat it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of the sparks that would be
blown over the houses,&rdquo; said the livery-stable
owner. &ldquo;Look up right now and you&rsquo;ll see
signs of them. If it was a dark night you&rsquo;d
never forget the sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hope those clouds that have come
up mean business, and it&rsquo;ll rain before many
hours,&rdquo; said Billy, fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>They had made rapid progress and must now
be in the region of the fire. The smoke was
worse than at any previous time, and others
besides Monkey Stallings had commenced to
rub their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go a little further,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Lewis, who had slowed down somewhat; &ldquo;and
when I find a good place to turn I&rsquo;ll have to
ask you boys to vacate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was doubtless figuring on his plan of
campaign. Yes, they did know this region
pretty well, which would prove a good thing
in this emergency. Had it chanced to be
strange to them they would not know which
way to go in order to render any assistance;
and in consequence their coming would be next
to useless.</p>
<p>On the way they had passed a number of
houses, and found the women folks the only
ones at home, besides the children, when there
were any. The men had evidently been drafted
to fight the fire raging in so many places in
the forests around the foot of the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Even these women were doing what little
they could to save their possessions in case
the fire came their way. They were drawing
water in all sorts of tubs and other receptacles,
some even digging ditches on the north side of
the farm buildings as though in that Western
way they hoped to keep the enemy at a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look there!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed
&ldquo;Whistling&rdquo; Smith, a boy whose recognized
ability as an imitator of birds had long ago
given him this nickname.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first glimpse of the fire line!&rdquo; said
Hugh, as all of them stared hard at what they
could see through an opening in the timber
bordering the road.</p>
<p>It was true enough. They could watch the
play of the flames as they climbed up a tree
that may have been dead, for it certainly
burned like a torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like business, I&rsquo;m telling you!&rdquo;
remarked Tom Sherwood, the water athlete
of the troop, and who could do almost anything
well, since he had both the physique and
the quickness of action that are so necessary
to success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a wider place in the road where
by crowding I may be able to make a turn
about,&rdquo; remarked the driver of the &ldquo;rubberneck&rdquo;
car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jump off, fellows!&rdquo; ordered Hugh, suiting
the action to the words himself, and making
a safe landing.</p>
<p>There was a hasty getaway, Billy turning
out to be the only clumsy member of the lot;
a slip of his foot just at the instant he sprang
causing him to roll over after he alighted. He
was seized and dragged to a place of safety by
his comrades before the car could back, and
run over him.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis knew how to manage, it proved.
He made a couple of turns back and forward,
and then had his car facing toward Oakvale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, boys!&rdquo; he called out to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surely remember this kindness, Mr.
Lewis,&rdquo; shouted Alec Sands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a pleasure to haul such a fine
lot of fire-fighters to the work they mean to
tackle,&rdquo; the liveryman replied over his shoulder.
&ldquo;Good luck to you, boys, and mind your
eye! Do all the good you can for these poor
folks up here, but remember, too, you&rsquo;ve got
mothers at home, and don&rsquo;t be rash. Avoid
the fire-traps, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE BURNING FOREST.</span></h2>
<p>When the car was lost sight of in the pall
of smoke that had settled down over that section
of the county, Hugh took it upon himself
to explain the plan of campaign which he had
mentally mapped out while on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever we do, fellows,&rdquo; he told the
scouts clustering around him, all with eager
faces, and perhaps streaming eyes, for that
smoke did smart tremendously, &ldquo;we know
there&rsquo;s no use going behind the line of fire.
When it&rsquo;s once passed over a place either the
damage has been done, or else the farm has
had a narrow escape. What we want to do is
to keep moving along in front of the fire, so as
to try to keep it from ruining some of these
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us our duty, Hugh, and you&rsquo;ll find
every scout on the job,&rdquo; said Alec.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that without you telling me, Alec,&rdquo;
the scout master replied. &ldquo;Now, to the left
lies the Heffner farm. I don&rsquo;t think the fire
can have reached there so far, though it&rsquo;s
heading that way fast. I&rsquo;m going to take half
of your number and strike through the woods
here to help Mrs. Heffner. You know she&rsquo;s
been trying to make a living for her little family
of children since her husband died two
years ago. If anybody needs assistance they
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only half did you say, Hugh?&rdquo; exclaimed
Shorty McNeil, in a panic lest some of them
be left out of the lively game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because I want Alec with the rest to
turn off to the right of us. You know how the
land lies, and what course to take to get to old
Zeke Ballinger&rsquo;s poultry farm, where he raises
squabs, and broilers for the city market. If
the fire puts him out of business it&rsquo;s going
to ruin the old man, for he barely makes a living
now. Do your level best to save his buildings,
Alec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly will, Hugh, and thank you for
trusting me with the job. How shall we divide
the troop?&rdquo; asked the leader of the Otters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick one, and then you do the same,&rdquo;
said Hugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep it up till all have been
selected. Billy, step over here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy felt proud of having been the first
choice of the scout master; but he knew very
well it was pure personal affection that brought
this about, and not any belief that he could
render better service than any of the other
fellows; indeed, the more agile scouts were apt
to discount all of Billy&rsquo;s efforts, no matter how
strenuously he tried to excel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Tom Sherwood,&rdquo; said the leader
of the Otters, promptly.</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s second choice proved to be Arthur
Cameron, for he knew what a useful member
of a rescue party the student of surgery was
likely to prove. After that they picked their
followers rapidly. It was amusing to notice
how each patrol leader made sure to get those
of his own command first of all, before turning
to others. Still, this was only natural,
since they were supposed to know the particular
virtues of those with whom they came in
frequent contact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The division was quickly accomplished.
Fourteen boys stood back of Hugh and an
equal number waited to obey the orders of
Alec.</p>
<p>The two leaders only halted to make an arrangement
looking to a possible combination of
their forces later on. If it was found that
their assistance was no longer needed at the
place to which they had gone, the party thus
set at liberty was to hasten to join the other.
After that further plans could be arranged;
for evidently there would be plenty of work
to do all along the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Alec, who was
plainly impatient to be moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, good-by, and hope you have luck!&rdquo;
the scout master told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you; come along, fellows, we&rsquo;re
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One party plunged into the woods on the
right of the road, while the other vanished in
the opposite direction. Of course neither knew
what obstacles they might encounter on their
way, or which mission would prove to be the
more difficult.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Hugh had chosen to go to the farm of Mrs.
Heffner because his sympathies were more
strongly aroused in her case. True, old Zeke
Ballinger was to be pitied, for he had every
dollar he possessed invested in that little poultry
and squab ranch, and would be utterly
ruined if the fire took it. Still, he was a man,
after all. A lone widow, fighting to make a
living off a small farm for her children, should
be considered first of all, Hugh thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ve got your points of the compass
right, are you, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Billy, with the
familiarity that years of friendship for the
scout master gave him. When there was need
of displaying the spirit of a private in the
ranks toward his commanding officer, Billy
could do it all right; but as a rule he met Hugh
as one chum would another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have, to the fraction of a dot,&rdquo;
replied the other. &ldquo;I know what a bad job it
would be to make a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it would,&rdquo; Billy asserted. &ldquo;If
we happened to get mixed up in the woods, and
wandered around, first thing we knew we
might find ourselves trapped by the old fire,
and beautifully singed in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading straight for the Heffner
farm,&rdquo; Hugh assured him. &ldquo;A little further
on we ought to strike the zigzag trail she uses
to come out on the main road. If Mr. Lewis
had carried us on a little further we&rsquo;d have
struck the junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boys were also talking among
themselves, but in a subdued sort of way.
Glimpses of the fire, which they could catch at
irregular intervals, inspired them with considerable
respect regarding the conflagration. In
fact, they felt somewhat awed, to tell the truth.</p>
<p>In the past some of them had passed through
queer experiences with Hugh Hardin as their
leader, but never one like this, with the woods
on fire, and people to be rescued, as well as
property to be saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that strange humming noise we
can hear every little while, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Jack
Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the roar of the fire, as sure as anything,&rdquo;
Ralph Kenyon told him before the
scout master could say a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does it come and go like that?&rdquo;
insisted Jack. Some of the other boys shrugged
their shoulders, and listened to once again
catch the peculiar sound mentioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wind changes, or else drops down to a
lull,&rdquo; Ralph explained. As he was reckoned
a clever woodsman, Jack accepted the theory
without a protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph is quite right there,&rdquo; Hugh added.
&ldquo;If that miserable breeze would only die down,
the fires might be gotten under control; but
so long as it keeps going it is bound to whip
a spark into a flame. If an army of men put
the fire out in one place they&rsquo;d hardly turn their
backs before the wind would make it spring
up again like magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the wind, anyway!&rdquo; said Billy energetically.
&ldquo;It blows billions of sparks ahead
and starts new blazes by the dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a good thing when you&rsquo;re sailing
a boat, flying a kite, or something like that,&rdquo;
asserted Harold Tremaine, the newest member
of the Wolf Patrol, he having taken the place
of a boy whose folks had moved away from
town some months before.</p>
<p>The going was not so very smooth, even in
the daytime, for matted bushes often caused
them to make little detours, and there were
other obstacles which had to be passed over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I&rsquo;d hate to be trying to run through
here at night-time,&rdquo; said Billy, as he caught
his foot in a wild grapevine and measured his
length on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a fire racing after you, eh, Billy?&rdquo;
remarked Ralph Kenyon. &ldquo;It strikes me you&rsquo;d
stand a pretty good chance of being roasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention such a thing, Ralph, if you
care for my feelings,&rdquo; the stout boy begged
him. &ldquo;I was thinking of some ferocious wild
animal rather than of a fire. Hugh, how about
that little side road you spoke of; hope we
haven&rsquo;t been so unlucky as to miss it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to come on it in another minute or
so, unless all my calculations are wrong, and
I don&rsquo;t believe they are,&rdquo; was the confident reply
which the scout master gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I can see something that looks
like a woods lane just ahead there by that silver
birch, Hugh!&rdquo; spoke up Monkey Stallings,
who was with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good eyes, Monkey!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack Durham.
&ldquo;That it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; muttered Billy, who was
breathing hard with the great exertions he had
been forced to make all this while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>It turned out to be as they said. The cut-off
road by which the Heffners were accustomed
to come from their farm whenever they started
for town lay before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something like it,&rdquo; commented Ned
Twyford, as they struck out at a considerably
faster gait, once they reached the open ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was,&rdquo; Billy said, as though
his every word might be uttered in a spirit of
sincere thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting closer to the fire every step
we take, Hugh!&rdquo; announced Ralph, who had
been noting all things.</p>
<p>Hugh knew that as well as anybody. It had
been giving him considerable anxiety for several
minutes past. Not that he believed there
was cause to fear for the safety of himself and
comrades, because that had not as yet entered
into his calculations. He was thinking of the
poor woman, who, alone in that burning forest,
with her little children, might be striving
to fight the onrush of those greedy flames,
eager to lick up her scanty property.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The very thought caused Hugh to start off
on a jog-trot. He was immediately copied by
all the rest, even fat Billy joining in, although
the effort made him pant more than ever, so
that his tongue seemed to be protruding from
between his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better stop that old trick of yours, Billy,&rdquo;
warned Bud Morgan, noticing this. &ldquo;Remember
once before how you took a tumble and
bit your tongue just fierce. Some day you&rsquo;ll
nip off the tip entirely, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you told me, Bud,&rdquo; grunted Billy, who
did not take offense easily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure hate to
be tongue-tied when I go to singing school,
or to see the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your breath, Billy; you&rsquo;ll have need
of it all,&rdquo; the other warned him further, and
accordingly Billy subsided.</p>
<p>All of them knew they must soon arrive at
the Heffner farm. Some, who had been up
there before, could picture the place in their
minds, and remembered how close the woods
came to the buildings on at least two sides.
Unfortunately these were the north and west,
for the farmer when clearing the land had concluded
that the big woods might serve as a sort
of wind-breaker in winter, a shield against the
extreme cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>That made it doubly bad under the present
conditions. It brought the danger closer to
the door of the widow. Between the woods
and her outbuildings there lay only a strip of
ground which bore an orchard; and it was possible
that, as usual, heavy grass had been allowed
to die there under the apple trees in the
fall.</p>
<p>Hugh was considering all these things as he
ran ahead, picturing them in his mind, and trying
to figure out just what he should set his
force to doing first.</p>
<p>As a rule it is the one who can plan ahead
who has the better chance of success. Sometimes
his schemes may go amiss, but often he
saves a vast amount of time by the process.
This was Hugh&rsquo;s invariable method of doing
things, when the chance offered.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hugh felt a thrill pass over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that some one shrieking, and a kid
at that?&rdquo; demanded Arthur, who kept close to
the side of the scout master while they ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded like it to me,&rdquo; Hugh replied,
&ldquo;though it may have been a pig squealing for
all we know. Let&rsquo;s hit it up faster, boys;
everybody let out a kink!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Of course it was hard on Billy, but he was
bound to &ldquo;keep up with the procession,&rdquo; as he
called it, even if he burst off every button on
his coat trying.</p>
<p>If the road had not been so very crooked they
could easily have seen before this what lay
ahead of them. True, the smoke was very
dense, and the air seemed to be charged with a
myriad of sparks that kept raining down upon
them; but at that it was possible to see some
distance away.</p>
<p>So fast did those sparks come down that the
boys were kept busy brushing them off their
shoulders. They also kept an eye on one another&rsquo;s
hat, so as to give warning in case any
of the head gear began to smoke.</p>
<p>There could no longer be any doubt concerning
the nature of those shrill sounds.
Every fellow sensed their meaning, and knew
that children were screaming, either in sheer
fright or under the stress of great excitement
as they worked trying to assist their poor
mother to save her possessions.</p>
<p>It was fine to see how those lads set their
teeth hard together, and endeavored to put on
a spurt, as though intent only on coming upon
the scene as speedily as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>There was no longer any doubt that the fire
had reached the Heffner farm. They could
see it in several directions, and the roaring
sound had grown much louder now. It thrilled
them through and through. Other experiences
in the past may have seemed exciting
while they lasted, but all of them had to take a
back seat when compared with this dash
through the woods to the imperiled farm of
the Widow Heffner.</p>
<p>All at once they came out of the copse, and
the scene was before them. On one side lay
the small farm-house, and back of it the barn
and other outbuildings, together with several
stacks, one of them of straw, showing that the
fall threshing had all been completed.</p>
<p>Moving figures could be seen flitting back
and forth. Hugh instantly made them out to
be those of a woman, and one man, together
with several partly-grown children. They
were bearing pails of water to dash upon the
sides of the outbuildings in the hope that in
this way they might save them from going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Even the children had some sort of pans,
and were working with all the zeal possible to
add their little mite to the soaking process,
meanwhile crying at the top of their shrill
voices.</p>
<p>Uttering loud shouts of encouragement,
Hugh and his fourteen followers ran forward
to the assistance of the brave but almost distracted
woman farmer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">AS BUSY AS BEAVERS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to us, Mrs. Heffner,&rdquo; Hugh told
the woman as he reached her side. &ldquo;You are
all tired out with working. Get your children
back to the house, and keep them out of harm&rsquo;s
way. We&rsquo;ll save your property if it can be
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was wringing her hands and very much
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am glad you have come, Hugh, you
and your brave friends. Save the place if you
can; it is everything I own in the world. The
children would starve if it went. But I must
keep on working, for every little bit helps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh did not waste another second of time.
There was need of haste, for already the fire
was creeping along through the dead grass in
the orchard, heading straight for the outbuildings,
and those stacks of hay. The latter
must have caught fire before now only that
they were covered by a board shield intended
to shed rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The scout master began to give his orders
as though he had been accustomed to running
a fire engine all his life, and also commanding
a squad of fire-fighters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get any sort of buckets or other things to
carry water. Start that pump to going as
lively as you can. Jack, you begin, and someone
spell you when you slacken up. Don&rsquo;t let
a fire get started, whatever happens. As soon
as you see it smoking, pour water on the place.
We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to fight it off, you hear, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of talk, Hugh,&rdquo; said Billy,
as he picked up a wash boiler and appropriated
it to his own individual use.</p>
<p>Each boy hunted high and low for any kind
of vessel that could be used to convey water to
the exposed sides of the outbuildings. At another
time many a hearty laugh would have
greeted the queer appearance of some of the
things they managed to scare up. Several even
dashed into the farm-house and came out carrying
pitchers, kitchen tins and even coal
buckets!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Of course, one fellow at the pump, no matter
how hard he worked, could never supply
such a string of constantly going and coming
carriers. Hugh looked around to see whether
there might not be other means for securing
a supply of the greatly needed fluid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Monkey, you and some of the rest
run over to the duck pond there and fill your
buckets that way. It&rsquo;s not much further than
to come to the pump; and the supply of water
isn&rsquo;t going to give out either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the woman came staggering along
with a bucket that she had filled at the pump.
She was almost exhausted, and seeing this,
Hugh deliberately took her burden away from
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take your place, Mrs. Heffner,&rdquo;
he told her, and when she made a feeble
resistance, he continued: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shortage
of buckets, and I can&rsquo;t stand around idle while
a woman works. Go back and sit down and
watch us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>One thing Hugh noticed with more or less
satisfaction. The children had ceased their
wild, hysterical screaming as soon as they saw
the stream of boys swarming over the place.
They had fallen back, and were observing all
that went on with wide-open eyes. Confidence
had apparently taken the place of fright. With
such a small army of willing workers on hand
it was quite patent to their childish minds that
the fire must surely be beaten back.</p>
<p>Hugh wished he had a little more of that
confidence himself, as he saw how the encroaching
flames were nearing the outbuildings.
He knew that some of them must immediately
snatch up old brooms, branches off the
trees, or any other sort of smothering article
they could secure, and proceed to beat out the
flames before they reached the threatened
buildings.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he handed his bucket over to
one of the other boys, and began to designate
those whom he wanted to accompany him in
his foray. He was careful to select those who
were handicapped in their work by not having
the right sort of water carrier. Any with
buckets might keep on doing just what now occupied
their attention.</p>
<p>In this way Hugh picked out six boys, counting
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get an old broom or any sort of thing that
will be useful in beating out the burning
grass!&rdquo; he told them, and that was the first
intimation the boys had as to what the nature
of their new occupation was to be.</p>
<p>There was not an idle scout to be seen anywhere.
Every fellow worked like a beaver.
The lone man, whom Hugh had supposed was
a farm hand, stopped in his work once or twice
to stare at the rushing squads of boys. His
face was blackened with the smoke, and while
it had struck Hugh that there was something
familiar about the other, he had really never
taken a second glance at him.</p>
<p>Hugh did not even wait until all of his bunch
had armed themselves with such smothering
devices as they could find about the stable. He
was already at work at the line of creeping,
jumping fire, having selected his point of attack
near the straw stack. He pounded,
whipped and beat at the fire with all the vim
he could muster, even jumping on what obstinately
remained, and stamping it out. That
stack must not be allowed to come in contact
with the fire if it could be prevented through
any effort on his part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Billy was close beside him, having found
carrying that wash boiler, even half filled with
water, no child&rsquo;s play. He, too, had discovered
an old stable broom, with which he was belaboring
the fire with savage fury, pounding it
as though he might have a special grievance
against its further encroachment.</p>
<p>When all of the squad became busy, they began
to make a noticeable impression on the
flames. Baffled, the fiery tongues darted out
a few times at the fighters, and then seemed to
give up the unequal combat.</p>
<p>It was just as Hugh knew would be the
case. Hardly would they turn to another section
than the smoldering fire was sure to
spring up again. So it kept them busy going
back again and again to repeat the whipping,
only to have the wind play the same trick on
them.</p>
<p>Alone, Hugh could never have managed to
keep the fire in restraint, but with such able
assistance it was finally subdued in that particular
quarter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>This gave them a minute to get their breath
and look around at the stirring picture which
often returned to their minds in future days.
Over to the north it was a fearful sight, with
the fire leaping up among some of the trees.
Pines were blazing like great torches, but oaks,
beeches and other forest trees did not seem to
be affected, the fire being confined to the trash
at their bases, such as windrows of dead leaves,
stumps, logs and anything else in the way of
fuel.</p>
<p>Those farmers who had their winter supply
of wood stacked in the forest waiting for the
first snow so as to haul it on sleds to the house,
stood to lose the entire crop, and would have
to cut anew. Others who had heaps of fence
rails laid by for winter work would also meet
with a complete loss, for the ground fire hunted
all of these things out and made quick work of
them.</p>
<p>Leaving some of the boys to keep watch over
that treacherous grass fire, Hugh hurried back
to see how the rest were getting along with
their work. He stopped at a shed and made a
discovery that pleased him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Jack, come and help me get this
spraying machine out!&rdquo; he called to the nearest
scout. &ldquo;We can fill the barrel at the pond
and drag it over to the house. I&rsquo;ll cut the nozzle
off the hose so a good stream of water can
be forced to the roof, and smother any spark
that drops. It&rsquo;s going to insure a home for
those poor kids anyway, even if everything
else goes up in smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Durham was only too willing to take
hold. He was strongly built, and able to work
like an ox. Together they ran the wheeled
spraying machine down to the duck pond, and
utilizing the first bucket that came along Hugh
started to scoop up the water, throwing it into
the barrel that was mounted on the two wheels.</p>
<p>When it was two-thirds full, he and Jack
seized hold, and with considerable straining
and dragging, managed to get it over to the
farm-house.</p>
<p>Just as Hugh had said, when he used his
sharp pocket knife blade to sever the nozzle
at the end of the hose, it was possible to reach
any part of the roof with a small stream of
water once the pump was set going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it, to make sure first before I leave
you in charge, Jack,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>A few plunges of the easily worked pump
satisfied the scout master that it was all right.
He saw a large spark drop on the dry roof of
the house near the ridge-pole, and had no difficulty
whatever in drowning it out with the
stream he turned in that direction, squeezing
the end of the severed hose in order to make
the water carry further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how it&rsquo;s done, don&rsquo;t you, Jack?&rdquo;
he asked, holding up the hose to display his
manner of making the opening smaller, and
thus increasing the force of the discharge.
&ldquo;Use it that way when you have to reach the
further end of the roof. And step around occasionally
to the other side to make sure a fire
isn&rsquo;t stealing a march on you. That&rsquo;s all.
The house is going to be saved at all events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just make your mind easy on that
score, Hugh,&rdquo; Jack told him. &ldquo;If my muscles
don&rsquo;t go back on me, which they never have as
yet, I can pump this thing all day, and stand up
under it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the other on guard, Hugh once
more turned back to other parts of the exciting
fire line. He noticed that the hired man
was still carrying buckets of water methodically,
and it struck Hugh he had been standing
by Mrs. Heffner in a way that was worthy
of praise. Still, Hugh paid little or no attention
to him, for a dozen different things were
passing through his brain then, all of which
had to do with the saving of the farm buildings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you reckon this is going to
keep up, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Arthur, as he stopped
near the scout master, to mop his face with
his big red bandana handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Hugh. &ldquo;I hope that
another hour at the most will see the worst
over with. If we can keep things from going
that long it&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;ll come out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but the air&rsquo;s getting mighty torrid,
I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the fire&rsquo;s passed us and is
moving along on both sides, as well as from
the north. We&rsquo;re in the midst of a big burning,
and soon even escape to the south will be
cut off, unless we feel like running the gantlet.
The danger now isn&rsquo;t so much from the
flames as from the sparks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re thicker than ever, it strikes
me,&rdquo; assented the other, making several quick
slashes at his shoulders, and then snatching
off his campaign hat to beat out a smouldering
fire in the crown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be worth something to us to save the
place for Mrs. Heffner,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure every scout is ready to work till he drops,
so as to make her mind easy. Think of those
poor kids without a home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can stand it for another hour, if we
have to!&rdquo; Arthur declared, and with that he
ran off to make up for lost time, rejoining the
string that was heading for the pond with
their buckets.</p>
<p>Many times did those sharp-eyed boys discover
a fire just starting, where a live coal had
managed to settle in some snug nook, and the
dry wood soon began to smoulder. The dash
of a bucket always put an end to these ambitious
beginnings, and so the buildings had up
to now been kept intact.</p>
<p>Hugh put his hand on the side of the barn.
He was worried when he felt how hot the wood
seemed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to start things so
they&rsquo;d go with a rush,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and
a hundred buckets wouldn&rsquo;t hinder the flames.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Just then he heard the children start to
screaming again, and the sound gave him a
nasty feeling, for he felt that it meant new
trouble. As Hugh turned he was dismayed to
see the straw stack was on fire, a spark having
managed to lodge in some exposed part of it,
and being unnoticed, had finally communicated
its fiery touch to the inflammable material of
which the stack was composed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it for us, I guess!&rdquo; one of the
scouts was heard to shout, when this new disaster
was discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">BACK-FIRING.</span></h2>
<p>Giving up was one of the hardest things for
Hugh to do. He had been known to work for
a full hour over a boy who had been a long time
under water, and then found the reward for
his persistence in seeing signs of returning
life.</p>
<p>Just because the fire had seized upon that
straw-stack did not mean they should throw
up their hands and cry quits. On the contrary,
it offered abundant reasons why they
should, every one of them, get busy, and fight
to save the pile.</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s voice rang out like the slogan of an
old-time Scotch border chieftain, rallying his
Highlanders to meet the rush of the foe.</p>
<p>He happened to have a bucket full of water
in his hands at the time, and with this he
dashed straight at the stack. The flames were
already having a merry time of it, and given
another minute or so of free play, nothing could
have been done to save the huge heap of straw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Indeed, it promised to take all the combined
energy of the scouts to fight the inroads of
those eager flames, once they had taken hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it, soak it with water, tear it to pieces
if you have to, but don&rsquo;t let it get the better of
you!&rdquo; shouted the scout master.</p>
<p>A number of the boys were attacking the
stack wildly. The hired man stood close by
and watched operations as though he had never
seen anything like it in all his life. Evidently
the systematic and determined way in which
those energetic lads went at things had made
a most powerful impression on him.</p>
<p>Once Hugh, seeing him standing there, called
out to him to lend a hand and fetch water if
he could do nothing more. The man aroused
himself and started to do what he was told.</p>
<p>It was once on the tip of Hugh&rsquo;s tongue to
ask the boys if any one knew the man with
the blackened face, for something about him
seemed strangely familiar, although he could
not take the time to figure it out, nor did it
matter. As it happened, something arose to
divert his attention to another point, and he
speedily forgot all about the unknown man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Such energy certainly deserved to reap success,
and in the end the straw-stack was saved,
but it had been a pretty narrow escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said Hugh between
gasps when he felt certain the last threatening
spark had been crushed out of existence, &ldquo;that
if this pile had gone there would have been a
slim chance for saving any of the other haystacks;
and after all of them got to burning
we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hold the barn
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chances are even the house would have
gone up the flue, too,&rdquo; declared Billy, who had
worked like a good fellow to assist in the work.</p>
<p>Billy was a sight by this time calculated to
excite the laughter of his chums. What, with
his own personal efforts, added to the heat of
the fire, he had long been fairly reeking with
perspiration. Streaks of black ran across his
face and made him look like a Fiji Islander
decorated for the warpath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about the map of Ireland, Billy,&rdquo; one
of the other scouts told him, &ldquo;you carry it
around with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly came from somewhere near
Cork,&rdquo; remarked another fellow, &ldquo;because he
kissed the Blarney Stone before crossing over.
Billy can soft-soap you to beat the band. He
gets nearly anything he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! heaps more than I want sometime,&rdquo;
laughed the good-natured Billy.</p>
<p>Having gained this hard-fought victory, the
boys felt that they must take a rest before
starting in again. Hugh surveyed the field,
and tried to figure from which quarter the
peril might come next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s getting to be a shift of
the wind, Hugh,&rdquo; remarked Arthur, who, being
known as a sort of weather prophet, felt it
his duty to observe all such things as clouds
and wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would make it bad for us again,&rdquo; asserted
the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the fire is bound to strike us
from a new quarter if the wind whips around
as it&rsquo;s trying to do right now; is that it, Hugh?&rdquo;
questioned Arthur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s moving into the northwest,&rdquo; Hugh told
him. &ldquo;Which would bring it across that patch
of dead grass that up to now seems to have
kept from burning. Then the woods are closer
on that side, and the heat would be greater on
the roofs of the barn and house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get busy again and try to wet
down everything that faces that way?&rdquo; asked
the other, as though grasping the conditions
by which they were now confronted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the only thing we can do,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>As soon as he had shouted out the new orders,
once more there was a hurry call for the
bucket brigade to start operations. Tired
though they might be from their late exertions,
the scouts never hesitated. The noisy
clang of the pump was again heard in the land,
and a stream of hustling lads carried water to
the new point that was threatened by the insatiable
enemy.</p>
<p>Hugh had made a correct diagnosis of the
case, for as soon as the wind swung around
into the northwest, that dead grass began to
blaze up and the fire started to travel swiftly
toward the outbuildings of the farm.</p>
<p>Once more the poor widow saw her cherished
possessions threatened with destruction.
Unable to remain still, she had again joined
the throng of willing workers, and was carrying
water as best the conditions allowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The hired man, too, staggered back and
forth with a bucket. He did not appear to
be very strong, but then Hugh, on noticing
this, supposed he was tired out from his long-continued
exertions. Doubtless they had struggled
against the encroachment of the fire for
some time before the coming of the scouts gave
them new hope.</p>
<p>It was a lively ten minutes they all put in.
Those who did not have buckets in which to
carry water stamped on the fire, and fought it
with brooms or any other like article they
could find. Led by Hugh, they defied the
flames to approach closer to the outbuildings
than a certain line.</p>
<p>Billy was so industriously engaged that he
must have overstepped the bounds of personal
safety. The first thing he knew he was feeling
uncomfortably warm in the rear. Then one
of the other fellows gave a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on fire, Billy! You&rsquo;re all ablaze!
Stand still, and let me whack you with this
broom!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, bend over, and I&rsquo;ll put you out all
right!&rdquo; cried Jack Durham, and immediately
following his words he gave the bucket he was
holding a clever toss that shot its contents all
over the fat boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re extinguished, Billy!&rdquo; he told
the other, laughingly, as he ran off to the duck
pond.</p>
<p>It was a satisfaction to Hugh to see that
they were mastering the new attack of the devouring
element. Several times there had been
danger of the barn going, for little blazes
started up; but a dash of water finished these.</p>
<p>They could hear a cow mooing wildly inside
the barn, and a horse was stamping in his
stall, being greatly excited by all this clamor.
Hugh had already made up his mind that if
the worst came they must see to it that the poor
animals were given a chance for their lives;
should the barn take fire in earnest, and all
hope of saving the building be lost, some one
must go inside and lead both horse and cow
to the outside air.</p>
<p>Fortunately things did not reach this desperate
stage, for the efforts of the hard-working
scouts to save the buildings were crowned with
complete success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! but that was a corking fight,
though!&rdquo; gasped Billy, when it was finally safe
for them to stop their labor and breathe more
freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we won out, as we nearly always did,
you noticed!&rdquo; suggested Harold Tremaine,
who had learned some pretty valuable lessons
since becoming a member of Oakvale Troop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to Hugh and his way of doing
things,&rdquo; added Ralph Kenyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done no more than the rest of you,&rdquo;
objected the scout master. &ldquo;Every fellow is
justly entitled to feel that he&rsquo;s had an equal
share in the glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough to go around, all right,&rdquo;
suggested Bud Morgan. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m as glad
as I can be that we came up here. It&rsquo;s been a
picnic fighting the forest fire. If we can&rsquo;t
help extinguish it we&rsquo;ve helped cheat it out
of its prey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved me from being ruined, my
brave boys,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Heffner, as she
looked at the group. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget it,
never. When my Willie and Ben grow up to
be big enough I give you my word they shall
also wear the uniforms of the scouts. If this
is what your organization teaches you to do
for others in time of need, every boy ought to
belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;if their folks
only took the trouble to investigate for themselves
what was going on. But we&rsquo;re all glad
to be here, Mrs. Heffner, glad to be able to
help you out. It would have been too bad if
you lost your home, after fighting so hard all
these years to build it up, and keep a roof over
the heads of your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could have lived through it again,
Hugh,&rdquo; she told him, beginning to cry, now
that the danger seemed over, for up to then
she had kept up wonderfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if the wind changed again and swung
in from that side over there, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
Arthur just then, pointing as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think it will,&rdquo; the scout master replied.
&ldquo;But just as you say, there is a little
chance, and to make things absolutely sure we
must get busy and back-fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Harold, who had considerable
to learn concerning many things connected
with outdoor life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in the old days out West,&rdquo; Hugh explained,
&ldquo;when a border man found himself
threatened with a fire near his dugout he would
himself apply a match to the dead grass. It
would eat its way up slowly against the wind,
and by the time the big fire arrived there would
be a section burned over. This would serve as
a protection to him against the roaring fire,
which would pass him by on either side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see now what you mean,&rdquo; commented
Harold, who was anxious to learn many of
these interesting things, &ldquo;we will go around
starting little fires wherever we can find a
clump of dead grass that hasn&rsquo;t been water-soaked,
and let them burn as far back as they
can. Show me how to do it, Hugh; I&rsquo;d like
to have a hand in this back-firing business. It
sounds good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boys, as well as Mrs. Heffner and
the strange hired man, had heard all that Hugh
said. No sooner was the word given than a
number of them started to run from tuft to
tuft of dead grass, applying a firebrand.
Where only a few minutes ago they had been
trying their best to kill the flames, they were
now turning their attention to coaxing them
to start up afresh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fire&rsquo;s all right, and a right good thing,&rdquo;
remarked Billy, wisely, &ldquo;if only you can control
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;like a lot of other things
fire makes a splendid servant but a mighty bad
master. We&rsquo;re going to get it to do our bidding
now, and clean off the dead grass on the
east side of the buildings. Keep a sharp watch
so that it doesn&rsquo;t give you the slip and surprise
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need fire to keep us warm, and to do
our cooking for us,&rdquo; continued Billy; and then
clapping his hands behind him he went on to
add: &ldquo;But when it bites holes through the
only trousers you&rsquo;ve got along it is going a little
<i>too</i> far, I say. And I might have been
roasted if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, Jack; you
saved my life with that bucket of water, even
if you did make me feel pretty moist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Ralph just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think you heard?&rdquo; asked
Hugh, when all of them had strained their
hearing for a full minute without catching
any sound out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been mistaken,&rdquo; admitted
Ralph, &ldquo;but it was like someone calling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">PETER, THE BOUND BOY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what if somebody was caught in that
fire-trap, and so mixed up he couldn&rsquo;t tell
which way to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Billy who said this. Always tender-hearted,
the stout scout was appalled at such a
dreadful thing happening. They all stood
there and stared hard at the smoke-filled forest.
Here and there flashes of flame could still
be seen, and in more than one place a tree
burned fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope it isn&rsquo;t as bad as that,&rdquo; said
Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people up through this section had
plenty of warning to get away, from what I
heard,&rdquo; remarked Ned Twyford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some of them would sooner stay and
take the chances, just as Mrs. Heffner here
did,&rdquo; Monkey Stallings suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could hardly blame them, either,&rdquo;
another boy interjected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to desert your property,&rdquo; the
widow told them, &ldquo;especially when you&rsquo;ve got
a family of children to bring up, and no husband
or father to lean on. But I didn&rsquo;t dream
the danger would be so great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;that if you&rsquo;d
known how bad it was you&rsquo;d have gone off in
the wagon and left things to burn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her two younger children convulsively
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I would,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;The
lives of my little ones are worth much more to
me than even the farm buildings. But it would
have been very cruel to have lost my home
just when I was making the last payment to
lift the mortgage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! there it was again!&rdquo; called out
Ralph.</p>
<p>The boys of the Wolf Patrol always said
Ralph had the ears of a fox. Either through
natural causes, or because of the training he
had received when trapping small fur-bearing
animals during the winter time, Ralph certainly
could catch sounds that were unheard by
his mates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>At this fresh announcement new excitement
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same sound you heard before, was it,
Ralph?&rdquo; asked the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As near as I could tell, it was, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think it may have been someone
shouting?&rdquo; continued the other.</p>
<p>Ralph shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemed like it, that&rsquo;s all I can say,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>Once again everybody listened. They could
hear the crackling of the flames as the fire
seized upon another half-dead pine tree not
far away, mounting upward with fierce rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, didn&rsquo;t you hear that?&rdquo; demanded
Ralph suddenly.</p>
<p>Several of the other scouts admitted that
they had caught some uncertain kind of sound,
though unable to say just what it seemed to
resemble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been a crow cawing,&rdquo; suggested
Jack Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else a dog barking in the woods?&rdquo; added
Bud Morgan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it can be,&rdquo; persisted Ralph, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
headed this way, because all of you heard the
cry that time and you couldn&rsquo;t before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh turned toward the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lives nearest to you over that way,
Mrs. Heffner?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bargers&mdash;oh! I wonder if he got back
again last night?&rdquo; was the answer she made.</p>
<p>Hugh saw that she was looking anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Mrs. Heffner?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; she tried to explain. &ldquo;Mr.
Barger is a widower, and has three children.
He doesn&rsquo;t keep hired help but has a bound
boy of about fifteen working for him. Poor
Peter has a hard time of it because Mr. Barger
is a drinking man, and not an easy boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he went away yesterday?&rdquo;
asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took a load into town,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely he had plenty of time to get
back home again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most men would,&rdquo; Mrs. Heffner explained,
&ldquo;but when Mr. Barger goes in once in a while
he meets some boon companions, and he usually
gets home the next day at noon in a muddled
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Hugh grasped the cause of her alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are afraid the three children have
been left there with only that bound boy Peter
to take care of them?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fearful that is what has happened,
Hugh. And think of those poor children
in the midst of that terrible smoke and
fire. Even if they haven&rsquo;t been burned to
death, there&rsquo;s a chance they&rsquo;ve been smothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the scouts had heard what was said.
They looked toward the forest with pitying
eyes. It was terrible to think of children being
lost in those smoke-shrouded woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do anything, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Billy,
looking as though ready to even rush out into
the forest himself if Hugh but gave the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is one thing that might help,&rdquo;
the scout master decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start out and scour the woods, do you
mean?&rdquo; questioned Harold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because we might manage to miss them
after all,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all join together
and give a yell. They&rsquo;re bound to hear it, if
what we believe is true, and can head this way.
Now, ready!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Like every other high school pupil, Hugh
had watched the clever tactics of the cheer
captain when they fought for honors on the
diamond or the gridiron with some rival
school.</p>
<p>He knew how to bring out a concerted shout,
capable of carrying a long distance, and when
they all gave tongue together the result was
certainly satisfactory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; warned the scout leader, as the
sound died away.</p>
<p>Plainly all of them caught what seemed to
be an answering cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be that boy Peter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heffner,
excitedly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s tried to lead those poor
children over to my house, not knowing where
else to go. Oh! please help him get here,
Hugh! The dear little things, just to think of
them being out in those terrible woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute and we&rsquo;ll give another
shout,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>When they did so the response came quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closer than before,&rdquo; said Jack Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting his bearings all right!&rdquo; declared
Ralph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must keep him posted,&rdquo; added Arthur
Cameron, &ldquo;and I hope none of them will be
burned seriously. I&rsquo;m glad I brought that
salve along with me. We found it good at
other times to take the fire out of burns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each time they sent out that cheering shout
it seemed as though the reply came from a
point nearer at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming right along,&rdquo; declared Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another call or so ought to do the business,&rdquo;
Ned Twyford told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor chap,&rdquo; Harold ventured, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s enough
to scare any one, just the thought of being lost
in a forest afire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them were scanning the smoky edge
of the woods as if they fully expected to see a
party of childish figures issue forth and hasten
toward them. It was a very exciting moment,
and one those boys would not soon forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see something moving over there!&rdquo; called
out Ralph.</p>
<p>He pointed as he said this, and every one
tried to follow the direction of his extended
finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is some person coming,&rdquo; ejaculated
Bud Morgan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only one did you say?&rdquo; cried the widow,
as though appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be,&rdquo; Bud continued; &ldquo;there, now
he&rsquo;s burst out on the open I can see him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one person?&rdquo; persisted Mrs. Heffner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it might be the boy Peter you
told us about,&rdquo; said Ralph; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s bending over
and trying to walk steady but he seems pretty
groggy. Yes, that&rsquo;s Peter all right, but he&rsquo;s
alone, Mrs. Heffner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have cut out for himself, and tried to
escape,&rdquo; Jack Durham hinted, with all the
scorn in his voice that a true scout would naturally
feel for any one who would be guilty of
such an act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed that of
Peter,&rdquo; objected the widow. &ldquo;He always
struck me as a steady, reliable, brave sort of
boy. It wouldn&rsquo;t be like Peter to run away
and leave those motherless children to burn
when the farm-house took fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! he&rsquo;s fallen over now, poor fellow!&rdquo;
cried Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s got on his feet again, and keeps
right along,&rdquo; Jack Durham declared. &ldquo;Bully
for Peter; he&rsquo;s got the grit all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The boy came staggering toward them. He
was, indeed, a piteous sight with his clothes
burned in many places, his face fiery red from
the heat, and his limbs fairly tottering under
him.</p>
<p>He pushed aside the tin cup of cold water
Hugh held out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save&mdash;the kids&mdash;they&rsquo;re in between the
rocks at the Dry Spring&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t fetch &rsquo;em
any further. Oh! <i>please</i> go,&rdquo; and with that
Peter collapsed in a heap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">AT THE DRY SPRING.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why the poor boy has fainted!&rdquo; exclaimed
the widow.</p>
<p>Arthur Cameron was quickly bending over
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him around, Hugh, and look after
him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do something for the kids
out there in the woods. Let me have that tin
cup of cold water, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that Arthur could be trusted to do
the right thing by the exhausted boy, Hugh
turned to Mrs. Heffner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what he said, ma&rsquo;m?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every word of it, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have had the children along with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I said,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Peter
thought of us because I&rsquo;ve been kind to him
a few times. He was trying to fetch them
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they gave out on the way; that&rsquo;s about
what I made out he said?&rdquo; the scout master
remarked, with a note of interrogation in his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I really believe Peter must have
done the best he could trying to hide them so
the fire wouldn&rsquo;t injure the poor little darlings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He mentioned a place he called the Dry
Spring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all know that place, and he would have
to pass it on the way here from the Bargers&rsquo;
house,&rdquo; Mrs. Heffner explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could find it?&rdquo; Hugh asked
next.</p>
<p>She considered for a brief space of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoke in the forest might bother you,
Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;d have to stand for that,&rdquo; was his
cheery remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could tell you how to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then please do it, Mrs. Heffner,&rdquo; said the
scout master. &ldquo;Here, Jack, Bud and you, too,
Don Miller, stand by and listen, because you&rsquo;re
elected to keep me company on this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how about me?&rdquo; asked Billy, trying
to throw all sorts of entreaty into his voice
and look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nominated to stay right here and
stand guard,&rdquo; Hugh told him. &ldquo;Fact is, we&rsquo;ve
got to have athletes on this trip, Billy. Now,
Mrs. Heffner, let&rsquo;s hear the directions, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First head into the woods where Peter came
out,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll run across a
stone wall. Keep that to your right. About
the time you reach the end of the wall you
ought to see the dry bed of a creek. Sometimes
in the spring, water runs there, but just now
it&rsquo;s as dry as a bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we follow the bed of the dry creek?&rdquo;
asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all the way. I should say it was all of
half a mile before you&rsquo;ll strike the Dry Spring.
Once it fed the stream that ran there, but now
only the rocks lie there. Peter must have left
the Barger children among those rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand, Mrs. Heffner,&rdquo; said Hugh.
&ldquo;Just tell us on which side we will find the
Dry Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep watch on your right as you go from
here,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;and while you&rsquo;re gone
I shall pray that you find the poor little innocents
safe and unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, boys?&rdquo; called out the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On deck, Hugh,&rdquo; replied Don Miller, &ldquo;and
I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad scheme for each
one of us to carry a full canteen of water
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, Don,&rdquo; admitted Hugh. &ldquo;I
have one already, you may notice, but several
more can do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were getting these, Hugh noticed
that Peter was responding to the treatment of
Arthur Cameron. He had come out of his
swoon and was eagerly drinking some water
from a bucket. No doubt his tongue and throat
were parched from his recent experience in
the burning forest.</p>
<p>When he realized what Hugh and his several
chums meant to attempt, the bound boy
started to get upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along and show you,&rdquo; he said, and
Arthur had to catch hold of him; he was so
extremely weak through exhaustion and excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re going to stay just where you
are,&rdquo; Arthur told him, severely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
in a fit condition to walk twenty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if they couldn&rsquo;t find the place?&rdquo;
the boy pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get there, Peter, don&rsquo;t you fear,&rdquo;
Jack Durham assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time,&rdquo; added Bud Morgan.</p>
<p>Billy Worth was not the only disappointed
one. Every scout who could not accompany
Hugh felt as though he were being cheated out
of a treat. They would all have been pleased
to belong to the rescue party, but at the same
time they had learned the value of discipline,
so there was no protest.</p>
<p>The hired man had listened to all that went
on. He had watched the business-like way in
which Arthur revived the fainting Peter. Apparently
the help, as Hugh took it for granted
he must be, took a lively interest in the venture,
for after the boys had actually started
he called out in a voice that was husky from
the smoke he had swallowed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope and pray you may get those children,
Hugh Hardin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Hugh half turned in his tracks as though
tempted to reply, but changing his mind hurried
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out for the stone wall, boys,&rdquo; he
told the other three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said it lay on the right, didn&rsquo;t she,
Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the Dry Spring lies in the same
direction from the bed of the creek,&rdquo; the scout
master explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This smoke is sure enough tough,&rdquo; remarked
Jack. &ldquo;It grips your eyes&mdash;and how
it makes &rsquo;em smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lively bunch of fire ahead of us,&rdquo;
observed Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pass around it,&rdquo; suggested the leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use wasting our time fighting fire in
spots,&rdquo; Don Miller told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep all our strength for the job
we&rsquo;ve got before us,&rdquo; Hugh explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope we find the place,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the poor, frightened kids safe and
sound,&rdquo; Don added, for he was almost as tender-hearted
as Billy Worth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They were now deep in the woods. All
around them lay the smoke clouds. It arose
from smoldering beds of leaves or stumps that
were slowly giving up their substance to the
hungry flames.</p>
<p>The low stone wall lay close beside them on
the right. Hugh wondered what it had ever
been built for, though there were traces of a
long-abandoned road to be seen in places.</p>
<p>All of them were constantly on the watch
for signs of the dry creek bed which Mrs.
Heffner had explained was to be their guide
all of the way to where the dry spring was
located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see it ahead there, Hugh,&rdquo; announced
Jack, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; Don Miller
echoed, proving that he, too, had made the discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time we struck it,&rdquo; said Hugh,
&ldquo;because here&rsquo;s where the wall ends. She described
things exactly as they are. It&rsquo;s a pleasure
to follow up such a trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The creek bed was plainly in evidence.
Years before there must have been quite a
lovely little stream of clear ice-cold water
gurgling between those moss-covered stones.
That was before the spring had stopped, owing
to some interior convulsion of Nature or rock
&ldquo;slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very hot and almost suffocating in
the midst of the forest through which the devastating
fire had so recently passed. It would
have been much more so had the trees been included
in the general conflagration.</p>
<p>Frequently one of the scouts would feel the
necessity for taking a mouthful of cold water,
because he believed himself to be perilously
near the choking stage. One and all were glad
they had been wise enough to carry those canteens
along with them.</p>
<p>There was no sign of animal or bird life
anywhere about them. Perhaps many of
these perished in the fire. Most of them,
however, must have found some means
for escaping through flight, or failing that,
taken refuge among the rocks, perhaps in hiding
places under the roots of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be pretty near there I should say,
Hugh?&rdquo; ventured Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve certainly covered half a mile of territory
since starting out,&rdquo; Bud Morgan asserted,
using his bandana freely in order to
mop his streaming face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that much yet,&rdquo; Hugh told them.
&ldquo;You know, in a case of this kind, it&rsquo;s easy to
think you&rsquo;ve gone further than you really have.
But we are coming close to where the spring
ought to be located, and we&rsquo;ll all be on the
watch for the signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never give us the slip,&rdquo; ventured Don
Miller confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it could very well,&rdquo; the
scout master told them, &ldquo;because when the
spring was working it fed the creek, so we
should easily tell where they joined forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I miss my guess,&rdquo; ventured Bud,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to strike that junction right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks so to me,&rdquo; Jack hastened to add.</p>
<p>Through the eddying wreaths of pungent
blue wood smoke they could see a pile of stones.
It lay on their right, and that was where the
widow had told them to search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks almost as if someone had piled those
rocks up, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Don Miller, as they
stumbled along, and constantly drew nearer
the spot that all of them had decided must be
the place they were aiming for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s what has been done, partly,&rdquo;
Hugh observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Peter heaped &rsquo;em up like that,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s about the kind of fellow
Peter is,&rdquo; the scout master replied. &ldquo;Think
of him doing his level best to save those children
when their father, who ought to have been
at home to look after them, was having a lark
in town over night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter is a faithful fellow,&rdquo; remarked Don,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afraid he leads a pretty hard life of
it there with Farmer Barger. When I get
back home again, I&rsquo;m going to see if something
can be done for him. He deserves a kinder
master, poor chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now close to the rocks, and all
of them felt thrilled with eagerness to know
what the result of their mission was going to
be. Would they find the three frightened and
weary little Barger children where Peter had
entrenched them; or was it possible they had
since wandered off into the blackened and
smoking forest to meet some dreadful fate?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The piled-up rocks made Hugh shiver to
look at them; he thought they seemed so like a
cairn or a burial place.</p>
<p>So, raising his voice, the scout master gave a
loud shout, his object being to learn the truth,
one way or the other. Immediately all of
them felt greatly relieved, for above the rocks
there suddenly popped into view several
tousled heads as the children stared around in
search of the one who had brought them new
hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">BABES IN THE WOODS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three! All there!&rdquo; whooped
Jack Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in great luck, fellows!&rdquo; Hugh assured
them, for truth to tell he had felt fear
gripping his heart as with an ice-cold hand.</p>
<p>If they had failed to discover the children
where Peter had left them after they could
walk no further through the smoky forest, it
would have been very much like looking for a
needle in a haystack to have tried to find them.
Following a trail by eyesight alone over that
burned ground must have proved well-nigh
impossible, even for practiced scouts.</p>
<p>But here were the children, ready and willing
to be saved. Indeed, they were already
stretching out their little hands entreatingly
toward the boys, as though begging Hugh and
his trio of chums not to forsake them.</p>
<p>Hurrying forward, the scouts were quickly
on the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>They found the reason why Peter had been
forced to temporarily leave his charges while
he went in search of help. The oldest child
could not have been much more than five, the
second three, and the youngest less than two.</p>
<p>Later on they learned that Peter had carried
the little one pretty much all the way, but when
the second child broke down and was unable to
walk any further Peter just knew he had to
do something different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, little ones,&rdquo; said Bud Morgan,
with one of his reassuring smiles that
made all youngsters like him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come
to take you to the house of your neighbor, Mrs.
Heffner. She&rsquo;ll keep you till daddy comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Peter said we must stay here,&rdquo; remarked
the oldest child, a boy who looked as
though later on in life he would be able to hoe
his own row much better than, according to
common talk, his father was doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter sent us out to fetch you,&rdquo; Hugh explained.
&ldquo;Peter would have come along but
we wouldn&rsquo;t let him, because he was tired out,
and burned in a good many places. You&rsquo;re going
to come with us, of course. Jack, you take
the little one. Put your arms around his neck,
honey, for he wants to carry you. Bud, do the
same with the second one. Don and myself will
look after this fine manly little chap here; and
when you get tired just let us know, for we
mean to spell you playing nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh said this in his kindest tone, and it
had always been a notorious fact that children
took to the leader of the Wolf Patrol as
though they knew instinctively that he was a
good friend.</p>
<p>The oldest boy did not hesitate after once
looking into Hugh&rsquo;s face. He immediately
put out his little hand confidingly, and allowed
the scout master to take it in his. Don offered
support on the other side, and thus flanked,
what was there to fear further? Let the forest
smolder and blaze as it would, with such
staunch allies between him and danger he
could rest stout of heart and undisturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Nor did the other two show any sign of rebellion
when Jack and Bud offered to lift them
up in their stout arms. &ldquo;Any port in a storm&rdquo;
must have appealed to the babes in the woods
just then. Besides, these boys looked kind, and
they had promised to go straight to where
Peter was, Peter in whom the kids seemed to
have unbounded confidence.</p>
<p>So they started back.</p>
<p>Hugh and Don led the way, with the little
chap between them. If the boy gave any sign
of being tired out either of the scouts stood
ready to lift him up, &ldquo;toting&rdquo; him part of the
way.</p>
<p>The forest looked just as gloomy and fearful
as before, only none of them seemed to
mind it now. They had accomplished their
errand, and the suspense that had weighed so
heavily on their minds had taken wings and
flown away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lucky thing all around,&rdquo; said
Hugh as he picked his way along, taking the
easiest course possible more on account of
those tender little feet than for his own benefit,
&ldquo;that the kids didn&rsquo;t think of straying off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have had a dickens of a time
finding them if they had,&rdquo; agreed Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shows that someone must have taught
them the spirit of obedience,&rdquo; suggested Jack.
&ldquo;I reckon now these two boys will grow up to
make extra fine scouts one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been their mother, then,&rdquo; declared
Bud, &ldquo;because from all I&rsquo;ve heard about
their dad he&rsquo;s a pretty poor stick; bad enough
while his wife was living, but a heap worse
since he was left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but this boy here were too young to
know anything about their mother when she
left them,&rdquo; observed Hugh. &ldquo;So I imagine
we&rsquo;ll have to look somewhere else to see where
they&rsquo;ve been influenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if you
were right there, Hugh,&rdquo; admitted Don, &ldquo;and
that it was Peter&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He struck me as an uncommon sort of a
boy,&rdquo; continued Hugh. &ldquo;He certainly was
faithful to his trust with these kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose will become of them
all?&rdquo; questioned Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mrs. Heffner will be only too glad
to look after them until their dad can come
after them,&rdquo; Hugh informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shock the man will get if he makes
his way this morning to his home and finds it a
heap of ashes,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think his babies have all perished
there,&rdquo; added Bud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll serve him right. A
shock like that might set him to thinking, and
to reform. I can remember that years ago
before he took to drink Alec Barger used to
be reckoned a fine-looking man, with a future
before him. It isn&rsquo;t too late yet for him to
undo the past if only he sets his foot down
hard on his failings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what the damage done by this
forest fire has been?&rdquo; queried Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they go to count up,&rdquo; replied Hugh,
&ldquo;there will be a pretty heavy toll to pay in
the way of farms ruined and wood burned.
Plenty of them may have escaped, something
like Mrs. Heffner&rsquo;s place did, but others went
up in smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the whole story by a good deal,&rdquo;
declared Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so terribly dry this
fall that I reckon there are fires burning in
dozens of places all through the East, from the
Adirondacks to the Maine coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it would rain,&rdquo; sighed Don, &ldquo;what
a wonderful amount of good an hour&rsquo;s soaking
would do everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I felt a drop strike me a minute
ago!&rdquo; admitted Bud. &ldquo;I was half afraid to
say anything about it, for fear I&rsquo;d frighten
it away. One thing you can see for yourselves,
though, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun has gone in!&rdquo; announced Bud, as
seriously as though that event might be the
most important on the calendar; which to tell
the truth was a fact, since the whole country
was in danger of burning up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, as he
turned an eager look upward. &ldquo;I noticed it
was getting somewhat gloomy, but thought it
must come from the smoke. But, Hugh, clouds
have come up and covered the sky. Oh! why
don&rsquo;t it start in to sprinkling right away. I&rsquo;m
half choked with the dust that&rsquo;s in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us,&rdquo; added Don, as he
started to raise his canteen to his lips and then
suddenly paused to add: &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the
matter with us, boys; if we&rsquo;ve been wetting
<i>our</i> throats every little while, don&rsquo;t you think
these kids would like a drink of fresh water,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Careless of us, I must say!&rdquo; muttered Jack,
as he stopped, got down on one knee and then
hastened to unscrew the cap of his canteen,
adding: &ldquo;Take a drink, little one, a nice cool
drink of water. It&rsquo;ll make you feel better,
and when you get to where Peter and Mrs.
Heffner are, you will have some bread and
milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the children drank eagerly, showing
how they must have been suffering. Peter,
being only a small boy, could not have had the
forethought to provide any means of carrying
water along with them on their flight, and the
forest rills were all dried up from the long-continued
drought.</p>
<p>As soon as the little girl was through, she
put her chubby arms around Bud&rsquo;s neck again,
and rested her soft cheek against his. It was
plain that the scouts had already quite won
the confidence of the youngsters. Children,
no matter how small, quickly size up those
who are their real friends; instinct takes the
place of reason with them.</p>
<p>Jack and Bud even began to sing one of
their school songs as they ambled along in the
wake of the leaders. The obstacles they had
met no longer impeded their path, and being
young and free from cares it did not take
much to start them going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;This sure is a queer experience for us to
have, Hugh,&rdquo; Don was remarking as he looked
around at their strange surroundings, with
the many columns of smoke rising from
stumps, half-decayed logs and deposits of dead
leaves, which, being somewhat damp underneath,
had not burned as readily as other
batches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it counts with a lot of others we&rsquo;ve
passed through in our time,&rdquo; the other told
him. &ldquo;When you stop to think of it, Don,
we&rsquo;ve been a pretty lucky bunch of scouts to
go through with all we have since the troop
was first formed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often have to smile when I think how
queer it seems that our fine scout master, Lieutenant
Denmead, is nearly always away on
some trip whenever these big things are
pulled off. This time we&rsquo;ll have another adventure
to tell him, of how we were called by
duty up into the burning forest, and what a
glorious time we had of it beating the fire
away from the widow&rsquo;s farm buildings and
hay-stacks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and bringing in these tots who were
the waifs of the fire,&rdquo; added Hugh, as he
looked fondly down at the sturdy curly-headed
chap who was so manly trudging alongside,
with not a single murmur, though the
way was far from easy for his little feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t do a single thing besides this,&rdquo;
Don asserted in a way that told how he meant
every word of it, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel that it was worth
our trip up here ten times over. I never ran
across such a fine little bunch of kids before.
No wonder Mrs. Heffner turned white in the
face when she thought of them being left there
in charge of only little Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is all right now, it looks like,&rdquo;
remarked Jack, who, of course, had been listening
to what the others said, for he was close
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I felt it!&rdquo; burst out Bud, and when
they turned to look at him he was found to
be holding his face upward as though searching
the bare treetops for something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another drop of rain, do you mean, Bud?&rdquo;
asked Don, with considerable eagerness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;Oh, why
does it wait to be squeezed out in driblets that
way? There&rsquo;s a heap of wet due us by now,
and the old weather clerk up yonder had better
give it to us from the bung-hole and not by
way of the spigot. We want it, and we want
it bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horses, Bud,&rdquo; Hugh told him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea we&rsquo;re going to get all we need
before a great while. Half an hour&rsquo;s drenching
rain would put out nearly every fire there
is. Even if a few old stumps did smoulder
afterward they couldn&rsquo;t do any more damage,
things would be so well soaked. By the time
we get to the farm-house it ought to be starting
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Bud, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to
stand the worst kind of a ducking if that would
hurry things up any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing that we can do or promise
will make the least difference,&rdquo; Hugh went on
to say, with a laugh, &ldquo;so we might as well keep
our coats dry and be comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re much more than half way there now,
I should say, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Hugh?&rdquo; Don
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-thirds of the distance you had better
put it,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>Hugh nodded, and then surprised them both
by saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do to help things along.
I remember that leaning birch over there on
the left. We struck it after we had left the
stone wall just five minutes, so you see by that
time we ought to be back there, which would
mean the farm-house in as many more. So
we&rsquo;re over the worst of the journey, and three-quarters
of the way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every little helps,&rdquo; admitted Jack, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m going to keep a bright lookout for that
old stone wall. It&rsquo;ll sure seem like a good
friend to me; and the kids will be glad to get
in a house again after all they&rsquo;ve passed
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer now!&rdquo; Don was heard to say,
half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think you saw, Don?&rdquo; asked
Hugh, noticing that the other seemed to be
staring straight ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something or other moving off
yonder, and in this gully, too, where the creek
used to run,&rdquo; the scout explained. &ldquo;I saw it
just as it went behind a clump of rocks. Watch
and see if it comes out on this side, fellows;
over there, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been heading this way,
Don?&rdquo; remarked Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which it surely was, and as it stands to
reason that no wild animal, a fox or anything
else, could have stuck it out through all that
fire, I take it I must have seen&mdash;there, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s certainly somebody coming this
way!&rdquo; ejaculated Bud, as they stood and
stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that smoke would only blow away we
could make out who it was,&rdquo; muttered Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; ventured Hugh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
headed up the gully, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder now if it could be their daddy?&rdquo;
reflected Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; the scout master told him.
&ldquo;He would be coming from our rear, heading
for the Heffner place to find out if they knew
anything of his babies. I&rsquo;ve got an idea I could
guess who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the smoke did blow away and they
could see the approaching figure very distinctly.
It was a boy, and he was limping painfully
along as though his feet had been bruised
by the cruel stones. No sooner did the oldest
child set eyes on that figure steadily drawing
near and nearer than he burst out into a shrill
cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, oh! Peter, here we all are!&rdquo; was
what he sent out; and at that, the bound boy
forgot to limp as he started on a run toward
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">WHEN THE RAIN CAME DOWN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that for devotion?&rdquo;
said Don Miller, as the bound boy came
toward them, his face shining with happiness
when he found that his fears were groundless,
and that all his charges were safe in the care
of the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure a lesson for every one of us,&rdquo; muttered
Jack, who possibly realized then and
there a few of his own shortcomings, and felt
reproved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you the boy was a diamond in the
rough,&rdquo; said Hugh, winking very hard, as
though the smoke may have been wafted into
his eyes just then, or for some other reason.
&ldquo;When we get back home I&rsquo;m meaning to have
the entire troop working to better his condition
somehow. He deserves the best there is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Look at that little
chap run to meet him, and how Peter takes
him up in his arms? Now he&rsquo;s coming to the
other two, and their eyes are dancing with joy.
You bet they think a heap of Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you start back again when you
were nearly played out?&rdquo; asked the scout master,
after they had seen the greeting the smaller
children had for the boy who had come from
the poor house to work for Farmer Barger.</p>
<p>Peter looked half frightened as though he
feared he had done an unwise thing in disobeying
orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t help a-comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
was so afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em, or else
that they&rsquo;d stray away, though they did promise
me solemn they wouldn&rsquo;t budge a foot. But
oh! I&rsquo;m right glad to see &rsquo;em all agin, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He limped along beside them after another
start was made, and persisted in holding the
chubby hand of the smallest Barger youngster.
Apparently a great load had been lifted from
Peter&rsquo;s faithful heart, and his own pains were
utterly forgotten in his new happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the wall!&rdquo; announced Bud suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like an old friend to me,&rdquo; said Don.
&ldquo;I know the farm-house isn&rsquo;t far away now,
and that means shelter from the rain in case
it comes down&mdash;course I&rsquo;m thinking of the
kiddies here when I say that, you understand.
A veteran scout has no need to be afraid of
a little sprinkle, or even a ducking in the line
of duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was feeling unusually proud of his
three chums. Perhaps it was partly on account
of the fine way in which Jack and Bud
persisted in &ldquo;toting&rdquo; those two babes, and declining
to let either of the others &ldquo;spell&rdquo; them
even once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming down faster now, boys!&rdquo; declared
Don.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt about that, for they
could feel the drops pattering on their campaign
hats. But then the farm-house with its
attendant outbuildings could be plainly seen
now, and the chances were they would soon
be under shelter.</p>
<p>A rousing cheer attested to the fact that
their approach had been discovered by some
keen-eyed scout, who had communicated the
pleasing intelligence to the others. There was
good-hearted Mrs. Heffner waving her hand
to them also, and evidently eagerly waiting to
&ldquo;mother&rdquo; the children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>So, presently the boys arrived, and just in
good time, too, for as they passed in at the
kitchen door of the farm-house, the rain commenced
to fall in good earnest. It beat an increasing
tattoo upon the roof of that kitchen,
and the sound was sweet music to the ears of
those boys. They knew what an invaluable
ally that downpour would prove to be to those
farmers whose property would otherwise soon
have been threatened by the forest fires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, old rain!&rdquo; shouted Monkey Stallings
as he capered about after his usual nimble
manner. &ldquo;Do the thing right while you&rsquo;re
about it. We need lots and lots of that stuff
right now! Don&rsquo;t be a miser! Act generous!
That&rsquo;s something like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! listen to it come down, will you?&rdquo;
burst out Billy, as he pushed forward to join
the circle around the three children, for Billy
was unusually fond of all little ones.</p>
<p>Mrs. Heffner had taken each of them in her
motherly arms. Then, thinking they must be
hungry, she hurried off to get some bread and
milk, the latter to be warmed, for the air now
began to feel chilly, since the rain had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lucky thing it&rsquo;s rain and not snow,&rdquo;
said Hugh, &ldquo;though that would have helped
some, I suppose. But after this there&rsquo;s going
to be no more fire fighting for Oakvale Troop,
you can understand, this season, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had our fill of it, all around, I should
say,&rdquo; remarked Ned Twyford.</p>
<p>Hugh cornered Arthur Cameron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to let Peter get away
from you?&rdquo; he asked the amateur surgeon.</p>
<p>At that Arthur chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he was a little too smart for me
that time, Hugh,&rdquo; he started to explain. &ldquo;I
looked after his burns, and eased them with
some of that lotion that is so fine to draw the
fire out. Then I happened to turn my back
for just three minutes. When I came around
again I missed Peter, and one of the boys told
me he had seen him slip away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you guess where he had gone?&rdquo; asked
the scout master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it didn&rsquo;t take me long to do that,&rdquo;
came the answer. &ldquo;I had seen how nervous
he was, and heard him saying to himself over
and over: &lsquo;I sure hope they find the kids.&rsquo;
So I could size it up. Peter had disappeared
and no one saw him go, but I felt pretty sure
he&rsquo;d come back with you; and I was right. He
thinks a heap of the kiddies, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they do of Peter,&rdquo; added Hugh.
Whereupon he began to tell Arthur just what
he and some of the others had decided they
must do to try and make the bound boy&rsquo;s path
in life less thorny.</p>
<p>Unnoticed by either of the scouts, someone
had drawn closer to them at the time they began
chatting. It was the &ldquo;hired man,&rdquo; he
whose face was so streaked with grime from
the smoke and cinders that his best friend
might have had more or less difficulty in recognizing
him.</p>
<p>Evidently he had been drawn there by some
subtle attraction. The subject of the boy&rsquo;s
conversation must have deeply interested him,
too, for he could be seen to nod his head in
the affirmative every time one of them made
some remark that did him credit.</p>
<p>When finally the two boys moved away the
man stood there for some time as though lost
in reflection. Then he laughed softly to himself
as though he considered that there was a
joke on somebody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>It was just then that the kitchen door was
flung wide open and a dripping figure of a man
came staggering into the room. Hugh instantly
guessed who it must be even before he
heard one of the children cry out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the man was passionately kissing
the babes of the woods, only refraining
from taking them in his arms because of his
soaked condition. Hugh saw that Mr. Barger
was still a fine-looking man. He also noticed
that Mrs. Heffner seemed strangely moved at
seeing him, though at the time he did not exactly
understand why.</p>
<p>Later on Hugh learned the whole story of
how years before Mr. Barger had been courting
Sally Slavin, but an unfortunate quarrel
had separated them. Both had married and
lost their partners. Since the death of Mr.
Heffner, the widower had tried to renew his attentions.
Though Mrs. Heffner cared for
him, she had resolutely declined to encourage
him as a suitor on account of his bad habits,
which he seemed loth to give up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>The man was trembling like a leaf. Hugh
believed he had had a serious shock, and so
he was not surprised to hear him say to Mrs.
Heffner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard about the fire up this way I
hurried my team as fast as a whip could make
them tear. Leaving the horses on the road I
made my way through the fire to where my
house had stood. It was a heap of ruins.
Money can replace that, but my terrible fear
was that my children had perished. Sally,
right then and there I got down on my knees
and promised Heaven that if only I could find
those babes again unharmed, never would a
drop of the vile stuff pass my lips again. Sally,
I mean to keep that vow as long as I live, you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh wondered why the widow should blush
so, and snatching up the smallest of the waifs
press the little one to her heart. He knew all
about it later on, and could rejoice in that those
motherless babes would no longer lack the care
they needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things seem to be turning out first-class,
eh, Hugh?&rdquo; remarked Billy, as he and the
scout master stood watching all this transpiring.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad Mr. Barger lost his house,
though. Perhaps Mrs. Heffner will shelter
the kids till he can put up another one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got plenty of room for them all here
in her house,&rdquo; remarked Hugh, with something
so suggestive in his manner that even
Billy noticed it and managed to give a guess
as to what it meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! is that the way the tide sets, do you
think?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a pretty fine
looking fellow, and she&rsquo;s as good as gold. Say,
that must have been what he meant when he
told about giving up his bad habits. Well,
it would be a fine thing all around. This farm
requires a man&rsquo;s care; and his babes need a
mother to look after them, though Peter tries
to do the best he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does turn out that way,&rdquo; remarked
Hugh, with a low laugh, &ldquo;what becomes of all
our big plans to better Peter&rsquo;s condition? He
could find his home here and be well looked
after, besides staying with the children he
loves so much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all coming out like one of those old
fairy tales we used to read when we were
kids,&rdquo; remarked Billy, as though that time
were ages and ages ago in place of a very few
years; but then when a boy dons the khaki
of a scout he jumps far ahead of his years,
and the dim past seems to be spanned by a
bridge longer than any ever built with mortal
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter looks pleased enough, you can see,&rdquo;
said Hugh.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bound boy was smiling all over
as he stood back and watched. When Mr. Barger
hearing what wonderful good care Peter
had taken of his babies, came over and
squeezed his hand, the boy&rsquo;s happiness knew no
bounds. If his life had not been all that it
might in the past, he realized now a new day
had dawned on his calendar, and that the future
promised much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll be getting down home some
time to-day,&rdquo; suggested Billy. &ldquo;Though if
this rain keeps up, we&rsquo;ll be a pretty well soaked
lot of scouts when we strike Oakvale. But
who cares for expenses? Haven&rsquo;t we all got
on our oldest duds, and what&rsquo;s a wetting to a
scout, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use bothering about that yet awhile,&rdquo;
Hugh assured him. &ldquo;The rain may let up,
and we&rsquo;ll get back with dry jackets. Then
again I noticed a big wagon with a canvas waterproof
top out there in the barn. If it comes
to the worst perhaps Mrs. Heffner might have
her horses hitched to that, and we could all
pile in like sardines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s another way,&rdquo; said Billy.
&ldquo;You know some of the people up along the
road have got telephone communication with
Oakvale. Now a scout could make his way
over to the road and call up the livery at Oakvale,
so as to have covered rigs come up
after us. Mr. Prentice said he&rsquo;d stand for the
expense, if there was any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh. &ldquo;Why
do you say Mr. Prentice, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; cried Billy, &ldquo;I clean forgot
that you were away when he told us who
he was. I never would have known him with
all that black on his face, and his clothes
burned in ever so many places. Why, the one
we took for the hired man is Mr. Prentice,
you see! He had come up here to fetch the
last note for Mrs. Heffner to pay on her mortgage,
when the fire coming closer kept him
here. Then he had to help her fight it off,
which I reckon he did all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Prentice!&rdquo; repeated Hugh. &ldquo;To think
that it should be Addison&rsquo;s father of all men
who happened to be up here when we were
showing what scouts were made of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Hugh,&rdquo; said one, coming up behind
the two boys, &ldquo;I want to confess right
here and now that I never was so glad of anything
in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">RIGHT-ABOUT FACE!</span></h2>
<p>Hugh caught his breath as he realized what
all this meant for Addison Prentice. Here
was the one prominent man in all Oakvale
who had positively refused to believe there
could be any good thing come out of this scout
movement that was sweeping like wild fire all
over the country. In a wonderful manner he
had been placed in a position to witness a practical
demonstration of the efficiency of scout
tactics and organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly is a surprise to me, Mr.
Prentice,&rdquo; Hugh told him. &ldquo;I never dreamed
it was you. Several times I found myself
looking your way, and wondering why something
about you seemed so familiar; but before
I could mention it to any of my chums something
would come up to put me off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you didn&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo;
laughed Mr. Prentice, &ldquo;and I think my wife
would try to chase me out of the house with a
broom if she saw me entering. But, Hugh,
would you mind shaking hands with me; and
you, too, Billy. In fact, I want to humbly
apologize to every member of Oakvale Troop
for the mean estimation in which I&rsquo;ve been
holding them up to this wonderful day, when
I&rsquo;ve had the scales lifted from my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It can readily be understood how joyously
first Hugh and then Billy each gripped a hand
of the quarry owner. Really, for the time being
they considered that this amazing change
of front in Mr. Prentice even dwarfed all the
other surprising events of this record trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seed,&rdquo; explained the gentleman, &ldquo;was
sown on the occasion of your wonderful presence
of mind, Hugh, in throwing that log in
front of the runaway stone car, and shunting
it off the track. In doing that you possibly
saved a number of lives, and me from a feeling
of guilt that I never could have survived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still held Hugh&rsquo;s hand while saying this,
and gave it a grip that told how deeply his
feelings were stirred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;I said to myself, when I could get my wits
to working after the feeling of numbness over
my narrow escape had passed away, that if
being a scout could teach a boy to show such
wonderful presence of mind in the face of a
sudden peril, there must be something about
this movement that I should never condemn
without having investigated further. And,
Hugh, ever since then I have been making
quiet inquiries and getting opinions from some
of our leading men without letting them
know what my object was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only what I asked you to do in
the first place, sir,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it was,&rdquo; the gentleman continued,
&ldquo;but I am an obstinate man, and persisted
in shutting my eyes to the facts. But I
was rapidly coming to the conclusion that I
was making the greatest mistake of my life
in going against such a great development of
the American boy, when I started up here this
morning. Well, what I have seen done and
heard spoken of you and your brave boys since
coming here has utterly overwhelmed me with
confusion and regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than glad, sir&mdash;for Addison&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo; said Hugh, softly and meaningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other went on to remark, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll
be no difficulty about his getting permission to
join your troop after this. Why, if he showed
any hesitation I&rsquo;d be three times more bent on
making him don the khaki than I was before
in refusing to grant that favor. I can plainly
see what a great list of possibilities opens up
before a scout. If Addison can, in time, become
as sensible a boy as most of your companions&mdash;I
might easily say all of them&mdash;are,
I will be grateful every day of my life that
Fortune took me up here to see Mrs. Heffner
at just the time the forest was burning, and
your troop came up to render first aid to the
afflicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really, there did not appear to be anything
lacking, for it all seemed to have come out
just right. If Hugh himself could have had
the planning, he doubted whether he could
have improved on what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you give me permission to tell Addison
that he can put in his application to join
the scouts, do you, Mr. Prentice?&rdquo; Hugh
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hardly have the opportunity, Hugh,&rdquo;
he was told, &ldquo;because as soon as I get home
I will issue <i>orders</i> that he must join at the
very first meeting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will make him pretty happy, I think, sir,
for he has set his heart on being one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let me tell you it will make his father
doubly happy when that time comes, for I have
seen and heard things I never would have believed
possible a week ago. It just goes to
show how foolish men can be to judge without
knowing what they are talking about. But,
Hugh, I shall try and make amends for what
injury I have unwittingly done the cause in the
past by booming it in the future. You see, it&rsquo;s
a case of right-about face with me. They do
say that I&rsquo;m pretty sure to go to extremes
when my mind is made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys will all be glad to know that
you&rsquo;ve reformed, sir,&rdquo; said Billy, boldly, but
Mr. Prentice only chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you hit the nail squarely on the head
when you call it that, Billy,&rdquo; he frankly declared.
&ldquo;In a case like mine nothing short of
a reformation would fill the bill. You&rsquo;ll never
understand how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being here
and watching the way you boys went about
saving the farm buildings. It seemed as if
you knew just what to do and how to work it.
I had a lesson I&rsquo;ll never forget. The boys of
to-day are in a class by themselves when compared
with my time. I can see now how they
owe most of it to the teachings of the scout
organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was getting on toward noon, and boys
are known to have ferocious appetites, especially
when they have been working very hard,
Mrs. Heffner busied herself in getting a luncheon.
Like most of her class she always had a
great abundance of good food in the house,
which was a fortunate thing for that army of
voracious lads.</p>
<p>Such a jolly time they had of it, everybody
trying to lend a helping hand until in the end
Mrs. Heffner had to chase the lot out of the
kitchen while she completed her arrangements.
But she was looking very happy, Hugh
thought; perhaps it was because a good fortune
had spared her possessions; or again there
may have been still another reason which she
did not choose to share with any one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>And that was a meal not soon to be forgotten.
All sorts of good things were forthcoming,
so that no scout could rise from the table
and claim that his appetite still clamored for
more. Cake, pies, jams and jellies, sandwiches,
milk, coffee with rich cream, hard-boiled eggs
by the score, even several cold chickens which
she had been intending to take to town for the
Woman&rsquo;s Exchange table&mdash;all these and much
more were placed before the boys, until even
Billy sighed and humbly confessed that he had
undone the last button of his vest, and could
not eat another bite.</p>
<p>About two in the afternoon it was discovered
that the rain had ceased. No one regretted
this fact, for it had come down so heavily
that every fire must have been long since extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our chance to go home, boys,&rdquo; announced
Hugh, at which there was a decided
scurrying around, as hats were looked up, and
good-byes said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to town with the horse and
wagon Mrs. Heffner has loaned me,&rdquo; said Mr.
Prentice, &ldquo;and if any of you scouts want to
ride, say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>There was not a single answer; apparently
the boys looked forward to such a fine time
hiking it for home that they did not care to be
separated. Hugh considered this a compliment
to the leaders of the troop, for it might
be thought that a few out of the dozen and
more would prefer to ride home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea we may find the other half
of the troop waiting for us on the road,&rdquo; he
mentioned, &ldquo;and if so we&rsquo;ll all go back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was sorry to see them depart,
even the three little Barger youngsters who
had become quite friendly with the scouts during
the short time they had known them. Jack,
Don and Bud would always look back to their
association with the &ldquo;babes of the woods&rdquo; with
a feeling of keen pleasure.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was Alec and his detachment
waiting for them at the pre-arranged
rendezvous. When the two sections sighted
one another there was more or less calling back
and forth, and cheering.</p>
<p>Apparently Alec&rsquo;s crowd could not have had
anything like the serious time that came the
way of Hugh and his chums. This was to be
seen in the fact that their uniforms, unlike the
others, did not bear signs of hard usage, with
holes burned here and there, besides being
pretty well water soaked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Of course both sides were wild to hear what
had been accomplished by the other detachment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to take the floor first and spin
the yarn?&rdquo; demanded Billy Worth, who was
really anxious to know just how far Alec&rsquo;s
supporters had gone in the way of fire-fighting.</p>
<p>Alec and Hugh exchanged looks, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ll have to toss up for it, then,
seeing that each wants to be last,&rdquo; remarked
the Sands boy, taking out a coin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits us,&rdquo; said Billy; &ldquo;and Hugh can
say whether it&rsquo;s heads or tails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whichever falls upward means the last to
tell the story, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you call out while the quarter is
in the air,&rdquo; Alec told him.</p>
<p>So he sent it whirling upward, and about the
time it reached its highest point Hugh sang
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tails for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coin fell to the ground, and numerous
heads were craned in the effort to see what
the result would turn out to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You win, Hugh,&rdquo; remarked Alec, laughingly.
&ldquo;Tails it is, face up. I&rsquo;m only sorry
I&rsquo;ve got so little to tell, because our work
wasn&rsquo;t so fast and furious as you had come
your way, if signs count for anything,&rdquo; and as
he said this Alec pointed to numerous small
holes burned in the clothes of Hugh and some
of those who had fought the flames with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Hugh told him directly, &ldquo;we
know mighty well it was only the want of a
chance that kept you from showing your mettle.
We happened to be lucky that way. So
long as you did your part the best you knew
how, what odds does it make how much of a
result followed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was characteristic of Hugh. He tried
to minimize his own acts, while at the same
time eager to enlarge upon anything a fellow
scout had been able to accomplish. It was this
brotherly trait that had made him the best-liked
fellow in or around Oakvale. Selfishness
and Hugh Hardin had little in common,
as every boy understood who knew the young
scout master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Alec, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t going to take
me long to cover the ground of our activities.
We got to the squab and chicken farm, and
found Old Zeke pretty nearly out of his seven
senses, because he expected he was going to be
caught by the fire, and lose his whole plant,
which you know would about kill the poor
chap, for he&rsquo;s got every cent he owns in the
wide world invested there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; interrupted Billy Worth,
&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s the apple of Zeke Ballinger&rsquo;s eye,
that squab plant. He ships a box of plucked
baby blue-rock pigeons to a big hotel in the
city every week, and gets cracking good prices
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Ralph Kenyon; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up
at his place, and he nearly gave me the squab
fever, too. I could see good money in the
game; but it takes a lot of time to look after
things; and what with school duties, as well as
scout matters, I couldn&rsquo;t see my way clear to
make the start. But go on, Alec, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be sure,&rdquo; continued the narrator
of the story, &ldquo;he was pleased when we broke
in on him. I never saw a man so happy. I
guess Old Zeke has heard a heap about what
the scouts of Oakvale have done in times gone
by, for he just up and said he knew now his
place wasn&rsquo;t going to be burned to flinders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Somehow every fellow looked proud when
Alec said that. It seemed to them worth while
to have worked so hard in the past, if by so doing
a reputation for accomplishing things had
been earned among the people of their native
town and the surrounding country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started in to get ready for business,&rdquo;
continued Alec; &ldquo;such as locating the water
supply, gathering all sorts of buckets, pans,
and anything that could be used for carrying
the stuff when the sparks came sailing over,
and threatening to set fire to the roofs of the
chicken and pigeon houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First we began to soak the roofs as well as
we could, and all the while the fire was getting
nearer. As luck would have it, there was an
open space between the woods and the buildings.
Old Zeke didn&rsquo;t have any straw stack,
or hay worth mentioning, to start going, which
I counted in our favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then finally we saw the flames begin to
pick up over to windward. The fire had been
carried through the thick woods. It was eating
up all the dry stuff on the ground, and some
dead trees were beginning to look like great
big burning torches or candles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we worked harder than ever, with Zeke
keeping on our trail, doing great stunts carrying
water and helping out. Every bucket
thrown gave us more hope that we&rsquo;d be able
to keep things safe and sound; but pretty soon
we saw that here and there the roofs were beginning
to smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d made sure to have what ladders there
were about the place handy. So keeping a
bright lookout, whenever a little flame was
discovered on the roof of a building some of
the boys hustled there with a ladder, and one
went up to throw a bucket of water over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was about what our work amounted
to, all the way through. None of the buildings
were burned down, though we did have a few
scares, and several times it took the liveliest
jumping anybody ever saw to manage all the
little fires that sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the end the fire had swept past, the
heat gradually grew less and less, so that we
knew we had saved the place for the old squab
raiser and chicken farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all, Alec?&rdquo; asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Alec, with a bright
smile, as he glanced toward Dale, &ldquo;we did have
just one little adventure worth mentioning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stow that, can&rsquo;t you, Alec?&rdquo; hastily remarked
Dale, who seemed to suddenly flush
up, as though more or less confused; for he
was known to be an exceptionally modest fellow,
who neither went about &ldquo;blowing his own
horn,&rdquo; nor liked to have any of his chums do
the same for him; &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t worth mentioning
in the same breath with the splendid things I&rsquo;m
sure Hugh and the rest have been doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the ones to judge of that, old fellow,&rdquo;
said Don; &ldquo;so please let&rsquo;s hear what it
was, Alec, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dale immediately fell back, for they were at
the time walking along the road in the direction
of distant Oakvale, forming quite a lively
bunch as they clustered around Hugh and the
leader of the Otter Patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was like this,&rdquo; the latter proceeded
to explain; &ldquo;there was one tall building with a
steep roof that had a pitch of fully forty-five
degrees. I think it was the main pigeon plant;
but then that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right in the midst of the fiercest of the
fight to save the frame buildings, when the
red sparks were falling thick and furious, one
of the boys shouted out that the roof of that
particular building was afire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I had been afraid of that right along,
you see. It was so much higher than any of
the others, and that sloping roof made it doubly
hard to get around. As soon as I hurried to
the spot I saw that the chances were we&rsquo;d have
a tough job getting that little blaze under control,
and it even looked as if the crisis of the
whole business had come around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big spark had dropped in just the worst
place it could go, and there must have been
some dry leaves and trash in that cavity, for
a blaze sprang up right away. It was going
right merrily when I got there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the ladder was slapped against
the side of the tall building Dale went up it
like a monkey. The boys pushed another ladder
up so that he could lay it on the roof. Then
they handed him a bucket of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have seen him hunch
along that ridge of the roof, Hugh. It was as
fine a thing as any city fireman ever did, I&rsquo;m
dead sure. And all the while Dale had to carry
that heavy pail of water along, trying not to
spill a drop if he could help it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we held our breath while we watched
him, and not a fellow called out any instructions,
for we believed that Dale knew best
what he was up against.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that time the fire was springing up as
if it surely meant to cop everything in sight.
But Dale he just kept hunching along, and
hunching along till he had come to where he
thought he could get the bulge on the busy
flames. Then we saw him hold his bucket up
as if aiming, and after that it was good-night
to Mr. Fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was as near an adventure as anything
we ran across, Hugh,&rdquo; concluded Alec;
&ldquo;so please start in to tell us what came your
way over to the Heffner farm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Knowing how eager the others were to hear,
Hugh wasted no time in beating around the
bush. He proceeded to tell what a stiff fight
he and his backers had put up in the endeavor
to save the property of the widow, and what
splendid success their efforts met with. In
vivid language he described how the hungry
flames had tried to devour the stacks and outbuildings
of the woman farmer, and the sturdy
efforts put forth to baffle their intentions. It
could be noticed that through the whole story
Hugh seldom referred to himself; if he
chanced to have had a part in the happening
he invariably spoke of it as &ldquo;we did this.&rdquo;
Then in the midst of his story came the appearance
of Peter, the bound boy, with his
thrilling tale concerning the little charges
whom he had had to temporarily abandon
while he went in search of assistance. After
that there followed the finding of the youngsters,
the triumphant return to the farm-house,
the coming of Mr. Barger, and finally, most
astonishing of all, the discovery that the black-faced
man they had supposed was the hired
help should prove to be Addison Prentice&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>As all the scouts knew about the decided
opposition shown by the quarry-owner toward
their organization, when they learned of his
wonderful conversion a series of hearty cheers
made the slumbering echoes in the woods
awaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to make it unanimous for the
scouts in and around Oakvale,&rdquo; asserted Alec,
boisterously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to remember another
person of consequence willing to say a
single word against the troop. We&rsquo;ll have
every patrol filled to the limit before a month
rolls by. Things are flourishing like a green
bay tree for the scouts. I certainly envy the
great time you fellows have had; but we did
our duty just the same, and if the fire had come
closer we&rsquo;d have fought just as hard as you
did, to save the squab farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody doubts it for a single minute,
Alec!&rdquo; declared Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man was grateful to us, too,&rdquo;
added Buck Winter, &ldquo;for he hauled out every
bit of grub he had around the house, and even
offered to dress some chickens for us, but we
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we about cleaned him out of eatables
that time,&rdquo; chuckled Dale Evans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe we weren&rsquo;t glad a certain fellow
we know was with the other crowd,&rdquo; remarked
Dick Bellamy, with a meaning look
toward Billy, who only grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>They managed to reach home before dark,
and such a disreputable lot of scouts had never
before entered the corporate limits of Oakvale.
But when the good people learned of what
great help they had been to Mrs. Heffner and
others up in the stricken country, they felt
that they could readily forgive their dilapidated
appearance.</p>
<p>It afterward turned out that Mr. Barger
and the widow married, and the three little
babes in the woods seem to be just as fond
of their new mother as anyone would wish to
see. Peter, of course, now has his home with
them, and the last time Hugh met the boy he
hardly knew him, there was such a great
change in his looks, for he had grown much
more manly.</p>
<p>In good time he will undoubtedly become a
scout, as nearly all sensible lads do; and those
who understood how faithful Peter could be
to a trust, feel certain he will always be a
credit to the organization.</p>
<p>Other adventures are bound to happen in
the history of Oakvale Troop worthy of being
written up, and at some future time it may
be our pleasing duty to once more follow the
fortunes of Hugh Hardin and his chums in
new fields of scout activities. Until such time
we will say good-by to the reader.</p>
